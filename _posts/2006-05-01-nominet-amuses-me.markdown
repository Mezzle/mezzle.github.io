  content: ! "Nominet allow .uk domain names to be registered by ISP's without first
    paying for them. They issue invoices to these ISP's on the same day every month
    and allow them a credit period in which to pay (30 days). Only once the payment
    has been confirmed can they issue a confirmation letter. This can also take a
    little extra time as it is issued via a secure printers, due to the security code
    on the letter.\r\n\r\nAll .uk domain names that are registered will receive a
    confirmation letter."

<p>Years ago, I registered a couple of domain names with some random register, and <a href="http://www.nominet.org.uk/">nominet</a> contacted me regarding one of those (holdings-carparts.co.uk) and sent me a certificate of registration for the domain. That was the only one they sent me anything for.</p>
<p> Recently, I've registered a few new .co.uk domains with my new host, one of them being dealer-network.co.uk (currently nothing there - so no point in going)</p>
<p>Well, anyway, this morning (3 months after registering the domain) I recieve a letter from nominet, asking me to go to their website and confirm my details so that they can send me a certificate of registration.</p>
<p>Uber weird. It seems to me that nominet look through the domain registrations and anything that might seem like it could be a "business" domain they contact so that the business can have a shiny bit of paper saying that yes, they own the domain, and no - cyber-squatters not allowed.</p>
<p> What amuses me the most is the fact that I won't actually be using the domain for anything business-like - I'm planning to set up a satirical site for "dealers" of "illegal substances". Ok, it's going to be a joke website, but nominet obviously must think I'm on about car dealers or similar. lol. Well... it's nice they do that - but why only for some domains not others?</p>
