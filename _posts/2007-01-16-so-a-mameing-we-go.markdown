<p>For a while now, I've wanted to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME_arcade_cabinet">MAME Cabinet</a>, being inspired by MAKE magazine and also <a href="http://www.tecspy.com/">Michael Erskine</a>'s appearance at <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2006/index.php/Main_Page">LUGRadio Live 2006</a> with <a href="http://www.tecspy.com/arcade/">his MAME cabinet</a>.</p>
<p>So, well, I've just been chatting to the guy who runs my <a href="http://www.globalgaming.co.uk/">local gaming cafe</a> and he has a Konami cabinet that was used for playstation games which he's trying to get rid of. (unfortunately, I can't find any information about it online!)</p>
<p>It's got the perfect sizes for a PC to be put in the back, hooked up with a couple of <a href="http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/p380.htm">Playstation-stylee controllers</a> and loaded up with MAME.</p>
<p> It could be fun... I just need to know where to start.</p>
<p> Getting an old PC to host would be a start... anyone got one they want to donate?</p>
