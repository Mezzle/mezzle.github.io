  content: Untill it's closed source I don't think that anybody else would seriously
    look into adoption. I mean, red hat, the ones who are against using mono, won't
    adopt this toy just to ease ubuntu's life. And as for features - for me as a bug
    reporter bugzilla was so much more complete. And what about that ugly UI?

  content: ! "I have to agree with you that a tool like malone is one of the greatest
    things since sliced bread.\r\nHaving a central place where all bugs can posted
    no matter the distribution or the application is truly a revolutionary idea.\r\nOf
    course, malone has still some bugs and annoyances, but that's nothing that can't
    be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe big problem with malone is that it's not Open Source. \r\nI'm
    having a hard time understanding why the open source community should use a closed
    source tool.\r\nWe have already seen what happens when an open source project
    uses a proprietary software.\r\nYou just have to remember when the linux kernel
    adopted bitkeeper.\r\n\r\nI am a proud ubuntu user and I love the distrobution,
    but I still prefer posting bugs in the upstream than using malone for that exact
    reason.\r\nI don't think that using a proprietary solution will help open source."

  content: I'm with the previous posts on this - until Malone is opensource and can
    metamoderate its own bugs I will have severe issues using it and will prefer going
    upstream directly.

  content: ! "Malone is not ready yet. In its current state, encouraging other distributions
    to use it is probably counter-productive (bad first impressions).\r\n\r\nOne cool
    thing coming soon is \"bug watch\" functions for Malone to track the status of
    bug reports in other bug trackers. Right now, you can take link all those bug
    reports you filed on qt-immodule in debbugs and the various Bugzillas, and link
    them to the same Malone bug report. Soon, Malone will start polling those bug
    trackers regularly to keep track of where the bug has and hasn't been fixed. Then
    distributors will be able to save time by using Malone, since they can copy an
    important bugfix from whoever fixes a bug first -- upstream, or any of the other
    distributions -- instead of shipping with a bug that they didn't realize was fixed
    in Red Hat or in Mandriva or in Yellow Dog or wherever months ago.\r\n\r\n(Opinions
    are my own and not those of the Launchpad team as a whole, yada yada.)"

  content: There is no way in hell anybody is going to adopt Malone until it is open
    sourced. If its not ready yet why do you want others to adopt it. If you release
    source code under a appropriate license more than just the Canonical people can
    help fix it, so dont use that as a excuse. There is no such thing as bad impressions
    due to early release in Free software.

<p>Ok, so not too long back a couple of us managed to thrash out a bug in katapult, and found out it was due to qt-immodule returning errorneous data. So - we fixed it in ubuntu - and sent the patch into debian.</p>
<p>Well now, it seems like katapult is hitting this problem in every single other Linux Distro, because people are starting to adopt qt-immodule.</p>
<p>I've just spent half an hour filing bugs in every major linux distro's bugzillas regarding this issue. What an annoyance.</p>
<p>From what I've spoke with Mark about Malone (http://launchpad.net/malone/) - it seems that Malone would be the best thing since sliced bread for bug reporting. But only if everyone were to adopt it. I could file my bug in ubuntu - say "yep - it's upstream too" and then say "oh, and it's also in gentoo, Mandriva, RedHat, Suse etc etc ... and when the devs from those distros come along and find the bug, they could easily see - "oh - it's been fixed in ubuntu - lets grab the patch from there - and fix it in our distro".</p>
<p>However, this isn't the case at the moment, as the only people who really use malone to it's full potential are ubuntu. And well - it's no good just having us.</p>
<p>Please, anyone who is a developer out there - and has a bugtracker, consider using malone - it makes life so much easier for us people who have to work with so many bugzilla's etc to get a problem in one place fixed everywhere.</p>
