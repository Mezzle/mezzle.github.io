  content: ! "Well, switching power supplies have a working frequency in the range
    of maybe 10 to 200 kHz. Ideally it should be outside the audible spectrum. It's
    not necessarily a sign of hardware failure to hear high-pitched noise coming out
    of it - if you leave out failure to not annoy you :)\r\nThat said, buying a high
    quality / high efficiency PSU is a good investment."

  content: You don't per chance have a hard drive that has a "Master" settting and
    a "single" setting, do you?  Sometimes, hard drives like that actually require
    you to tell them they're the only drive on the channel, as opposed to the Master
    on the channel.

  content: Some hard drives have different jumper settings for "Master" and "Single
    Drive" you might want to check all your jumpers on the two "good" drives.

<p>So, after finding out that that nasty noise my PC's been making was actually a hard drive failing (I knew it was, but thought I'd fix it now, while I'm doing my refresher) So, after a few failed install attempts with lovely kernel messages telling me that the disk was failing horribly, I thought, ok, I'll shut down, unplug the hard drive, and get on without it.</p>
<p>Ha, if only I were so lucky. Seems that for some reason, my PC, having had 2 hard drives connected to the primary IDE channel for the last... oh, 4 years? doesn't like it - and now, my primary IDE channel is unusable (or at least, nothing is being detected from it :()</p>
<p>So, that leaves me with 1 hard drive.... at least it's the bigger of the three. However, my PSU has also developed a high pitched squealing noise, which to be quite honest, sounds dangerous.</p>
<p>So, it's with some regret that I say that, I'm going to be out of commission for a while. I still, however, have my eeePC available, which is a blessing, as it means I'll still be able to surf and access email.</p>
<p>However, with apathy out of action, and with christmas around the corner, and lots of bills to pay, it's unlikely to be until around March that I have enough in the coffers to pay for a replacement.</p>
<p>Thank god for the eeePC</p>
