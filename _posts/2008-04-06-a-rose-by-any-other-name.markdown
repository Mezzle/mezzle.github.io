<p>In contrast to <a href="http://madduck.net/blog/2008.04.04:nicknames/">Martin F. Krafft</a> and <a href="http://blog.digital-scurf.org/2008/04/04#hello-my-name-is">Daniel Silverstone</a>, I personally, prefer to be called by my online nickname.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this is simple. The name I (now) use for myself online actually comes from what most people in real life call me. The name "Mez" is a contraction of my surname "Meredith" (apparently) and is the name I go by as online, as well as in real life. Daniel also says that he finds it hard for his name to recognise "Kinnison" as someone trying to get his attention. I'm the opposite. I actually find it harder for my brain to recognise "Martin" as someone trying to get my attention, unless I'm in a situation where I'm expecting people to be calling me by that (usually with family, as they are the only people to call me by that name). I'm sure if you ever speak to my work colleagues, they'll be able to confirm that my selective hearing only ever really picks up "Mez" :D</p>
<p>I however, unlike some people I know, have no problem with people calling me by my "Real" Name (though a definition of what is real is vague, and although I can't find a citation, I'm pretty sure that UK law defines the name of someone as that of which they are called by and respond to (given name))</p>
<p>But it's all good. If you want to get my attention though, I'd try shouting "Mez" at me. (and not "M<em>ee</em>z or Me<em>ss,</em> cause that DOES annoy me</p>
