  content: ! 'Please also make it a requirement to make the site at least XHTML 1.0
    Strict valid :)


    preferably even XHTML 1.1 (in that case you''ll need an IE6 fallback if IE6 compatibility
    is desired; could be fixed through PHP headers or the webserver itself though)


    My design skills are not the best though,

    so I''ll just wish everyone the best with the competition.'

<p>Radio Amarok is looking for a design for their new website.</p>
<p>As a community project, we're opening up the design as a competition to the general public, so if you're an arty type, want to contribute to Open Source, and want your work out there, then please do enter the competition.</p>
<p><u> Requirements</u></p>
<p>Minimum requirements for a submission are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>The design must be released under a Creative Commons licence</li>
<li>We must receive the minimum of a PNG mock-up, and SVG/PSD sources</li>
<li>All entries must be made before the 31st October</li>
<li>All submissions to be made to submissions@radioamarok.com</li>
</ul>
<p>After the 31st, the top designs will be picked out by the Radio Amarok team, and a vote will be put out for one week to the general public to decide which design they want for the site.</p>
<p>So, get your virtual paintbrushes out, and get designing - we've had some great entries already, and haven't even announced it yet!</p>
<p>More information will be available soon at http://www.radioamarok.com/</p>
