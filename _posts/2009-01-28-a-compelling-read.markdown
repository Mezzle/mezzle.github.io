  content: ! "I've just finished this book and it's probably the most entertaining
    I've ever read. I simply love the idea behind it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the ending
    seems a bit lacking but overall it made a great impression.\r\n\r\nAlso if I had
    missed your previous entry about feedbooks, I probably wouldn't even know about
    Doctorow so thanks :)"

  content: ! "I really wish I could afford an ebook reader of some sort. I just can't
    do with reading ebooks in bed with this 15.4\" laptop; I want something hand held.
    Looking at the Sony stuff though, they start at around Â£200, which I don't have
    at the moment.\r\n\r\nI actually considered printing out Make magazine, but quickly
    found out that printing it nicely would cost me around Â£20 an issue... might
    was well just get the physical subscription for that."

<p>Now, It's probably obvious to anyone reading this blog what my thoughts on Open Source and Licencing are, so I won't go into that. However, I've recently found a new author, who I'm liking a LOT.</p>
<p>His name is Cory Doctorow, and after reading some of his short stories, I thought I'd look into his longer stuff. As I've mentioned before, I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.feedbooks.com/">feedbooks.com</a> - and, as an author who's releasing his works under a Creative Commons licence, his stuff is also there.</p>
<p>I started reading one of his books called "Little Brother" (<a href="http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2466">http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2466</a>). I read the intro, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>It's kind of hard to explain what I mean, so I'd suggest if you're interested, goto the link above, and click on the PDF link, then read pages 4 through 12 (the introduction/foreword to the book) and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>I'll probably review the book once I've finished it (curled up in bed with my trusty eeePC), but from what I've read, and that intro, Cory Doctorow is fast becoming one of my favourite authors.</p>
<p>You can find more about Cory Doctorow, and his works at <a href="http://craphound.com/">http://craphound.com/</a></p>
