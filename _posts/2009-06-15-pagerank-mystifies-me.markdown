  content: ! "That behavior confused me for awhile, but then I read somewhere that
    the number of inbound links and the phrases which are in the a tags makes a large
    difference. So if enough other websites linked the word \"kowabunga\" to your
    site, it would probably show up in search results even if it had nothing to do
    with \"kowabunga\".\r\n\r\nThe description of your search listing makes me think
    a lot of other people are linking to your site using your name as the anchor text."

  content: Page's basic idea is actually quite easy. You can read the paper online
    (http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html). Blog's often have a good Pagerank,
    because of the crosslinks / blogrolls / aggregations.

  content: Andre seems to be right. My own blog has a pagerank of 4, and it is only
    linked on Planet, on the project site of some small app I'm developing, and on
    other Wordpress blogs where I write it in the identification fields of replies,
    just as now.

  content: ! "I agree with the cross linking factor. Dont forget the amount of pingbacks
    or things like digg and technorati.\r\n\r\nMy own blog is listed on search engines
    on page 1 for the phrase kde4. The main reason for that is the phrase is part
    of the domainname."

  content: ! "I had similar experiences with my site, until I cocked it up.\r\n\r\nI
    was 2nd result for my name, which seems to be shared by a lot of people. I don't
    really put my site anywhere, and don't generally make a habit of posting comments
    etc.\r\n\r\nThis prompted me to experiment a little, the first result didn't strike
    me as one that would have a lot of incoming links, but it had an exact match for
    the keywords being searched (Mike Hughes), so I bought mike-hughes.net and gave
    that a go - After 301'ing the old site to the new, and \"moving\" the site with
    google webmaster tools, I've now disappeared from the face of google."

    amount \r\nof work? I've no expertise in coding but I was hoping to start my own
    blog soon. Anyway, if you have any ideas or techniques for \r\nnew blog owners
    please share. I know this is off topic however I simply \r\nneeded to ask. Thanks
    a lot!"

<p>So, because of my work for an online <a href="http://www.mobilefun.co.uk/">Mobile Phone Accessories</a> Site - I recently installed a <a href="http://pizzaseo.com/firefox-pagerank">Pagerank Plugin for Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when I loaded up my blog and found that I had a PageRank of 5. I've never done any "SEO" work on my site, and until recently, it was a bog-standard wordpress installation. (now I have a theme, and I point at feedburner, as I was curious about statistics)</p>
<p>It's kind of nice to know that a simple blog can achieve a decent PageRank, without actually doing anything special :D</p>
<p>I think what mystifies me more, however, is the fact that googling for my name brings up my site within the first page of results, even though my name isn't mentioned anywhere on the site (I guess I can blame the planets for that though!)</p>
<p>I've got to admit, I'm quite happy that even though a famous author shares my name, I'm still on the first page of results in Google.</p>
