  content: A lightweight bit of ajax to auto-update the sign while-you-watch would
    be cool, saves having to hit refresh all the time.  Likewise, ajaxifying the submission
    part will increase responsiveness. If you do this in parallel, you can permit
    the display to update while you edit it, so you can see others changes while you're
    composing yours.

  content: Also, the cutesy font is nice and all, but overall, it'd be faster if it
    was just plain text, less server load and traffic for you too.

<p>So, fanatical readers of my blog (are there any?) may remember a long time back that I <a href="http://www.sourceguru.net/archives/26">got bored and wrote a little script that amused me</a>.</p>
<p>While testing something out yesterday, I needed to find a domain that I wasn't using in production so I could test on it. I stumbled across <a href="http://www.cheesenibbles.com/">Cheese Nibbles</a> which had a lovely "We'll be back with something cool soon" message on it.</p>
<p>So, I did my tests, and they worked. Everything's good. I'd actually forgotten what was on Cheese Nibbles in the first place, so I started rooting round in the code. I found the old site, and I decided to resurrect it.</p>
<p>I posted in a couple of IRC channels, to see if other people found the site amusing, and got the following back in response</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Daviey&gt; neat<br />
&lt;Daviey&gt; Mez: rss feed needed<br />
&lt;Mez&gt; Daviey: *chuckles*<br />
&lt;Mez&gt; but then it'd be twitter<br />
&lt;Daviey&gt; sure, but a shared account :)<br />
&lt;Daviey&gt; Or.. make it twitter when changed</p></blockquote>
<p>So, well, thanks to <a href="http://www.daviey.com/">Dave Walker</a>'s suggestion, I did a quick google, and within 6 minutes, had it working. You can find the twitter feed at <a href="http://twitter.com/cheesenibbles">http://twitter.com/cheesenibbles</a></p>
<p>Also, over the last couple of weeks I've been working with <a href="http://www.commandline.org.uk/">Zeth</a> from my <a href="http://sb.lug.org.uk/">local LUG</a> (and the tech, who shall remain anonymous, like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_stig">The Stig</a>") on a podcast, which we are, for now calling "The Podcast" (imaginative I know).</p>
<p>I was interviewed in the first podcast (which Zeth did alone, and I (apparently) provided the comedy element for) and presented with Zeth for the second one. Also, as the second one was recorded during the Ubuntu Global Bug Jam, of which I was running one of the venues, I actually allowed myself to be interviewed for it aswell. The podcast is very rough around the edges at the moment, and well, we haven't got a website, or an RSS feed yet, but you can find the show notes <a href="http://commandline.org.uk/audio/podcast-knock-on-the-door/">here</a>, and download the podcast episode in either <a href="http://media.commandline.org.uk/audio/knock-on-the-door-2009-02-27.mp3">MP3 Format</a>, or <a href="http://media.commandline.org.uk/audio/knock-on-the-door-2009-02-27.ogg">OGG Format</a></p>
<p>All comments/thoughts/suggestions welcome!</p>
