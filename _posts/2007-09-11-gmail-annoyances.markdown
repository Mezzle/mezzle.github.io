  content: I believe that if you set your Ubuntu email as your default address in
    the Gmail settings (on the accounts tab), the Gmail SMTP server will send using
    that email. I haven't actually tried it, but I think I read that somewhere.

<p>Ok, so recently, I thought that my status as an ubuntu developer had expired, as I've had emails about my membership to ubuntu-dev expiring, and when I tried to send an email to a list in ubuntu (kubuntu-devel) it got bounced back to me. Now of course, I thought that the bounce was because the list was restricted for posting to developers only (as is ubuntu-devel)</p>
<p>I finally got a hold of a member of the Ubuntu Technical Board (thanks keybuk!) who explained to me..</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Keybuk&gt; ubuntu-dev is a dead team<br />
&lt;Keybuk&gt; rather than reject everyone, we're just letting the membership expire naturally<br />
&lt;Keybuk&gt; motu is the active "universe upload" team</p></blockquote>
<p>So I then went to look what was going on with my email.</p>
<p>As my ubuntu email recieves a HUGE amount of traffic. (I dread to think but just checked and it seems I've had ~15000 emails go through it since march... a lot less than I'd expected) I have it setup in launchpad to go through a gmail account which means that I don't overload my own server (as I was doing before when I hadn't learnt to tweak my mailserver so it's settings didn'tput my server into swap death!)</p>
<p>I was also sending outgoing email from my ubuntu email address through gmail's smtp service.</p>
<p>However, it seems recently, that gmail will now rewrite an email address if it isn't the one you're sending through. If I send an email as if it's coming from mez@ubuntu.com, then gmail's smtp server will rewrite it so that it comes from mez.ubuntu@gmail.com...</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>I've now changed my email setup to use my server for all outgoing mail.</p>
