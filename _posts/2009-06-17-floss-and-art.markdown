<p>So, recently (the last couple of months), I've been involved with the <a href="http://www.fizzpop.org.uk/">Birmingham Hackspace (aka FizzPop)</a>, and I've found it a great community to be part of. For those who aren't in the know, a HackSpace is a place where a group of people interested in Hacking (and that's not the bad sense of the word, nor just the coding sense of the word - there's a lot of Hardware hacking going on :D) can get together, share a space, share knowledge, and come up with some mad and cool inventions!</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the group's main leaders, <a href="http://www.hellocatfood.com/">Antonio Roberts</a> is very very arty, but is also pretty much your classic computer geek too. It's been interesting talking to him of late regarding his journey into the FLOSS world, and how he's coping with that, and integrating it into his artwork.</p>
<p>For all those interested, he's doing a talk at the <a href="http://birmingham.lug.org.uk">Birmingham LUG</a> tomorrow about FLOSS and the art community tomorrow (Thursday 18th June), and you'll be able to watch his talk <a href="http://autoview.autotrain.org/course/view.php?id=6">Live on the internet</a>. The talk is starting at approximately 7:30 UK time. You'll also be able to interact with us on IRC, we're on the Freenode Network, in the channel #sblug, and for those of you who miss it, a video of the talk will be available online at some point after the talk on <a href="http://www.sourceguru.org/videos/">my Video site</a>. (where you can also find videos of past talks, including <a href="http://blog.daviey.com">Dave Walker's</a> talk about <a href="http://www.mythbuntu.org/">Mythbuntu</a>, and <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/">Scott James Remnant</a>'s talk about <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">Upstart</a>)</p>
