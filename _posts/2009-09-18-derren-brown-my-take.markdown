  content: Far simpler that that. It was expectation and hypnosis before the film.
    The flash frames and film weren't necessary at all, though the film helped people
    relax and zone out.

    there to convince people of the reality of subliminal suggestion for the purpose
    of the show and particularly to enhance the sticking in the chair trick later
    on.\r\n\r\nIt is much more likely to have been an old fashioned sleight-of-hand
    card trick.\r\n\r\n@aseigo yes a lot of his techniques are related to NLP techniques."

  content: ! "watching it now - the picking people out of a line-up again the \"subliminal\"
    squares are nothing to do with how the trick works.\r\n\r\nNotice at the beginning
    he mentions the number 19 several times, each time next to a positive word or
    phrase such as \"19 have win on the back\". I was trying to look to see if he
    gives her other cues to fix 19 in her mind but I didn't see any. \r\n\r\nAlso
    I'm not sure about this but it looks like when they come out 19 is holding his
    head up a little more, looking a little more confident than the others - so when
    she looks at him she feels confident. Notice that he gets her to look at the peoples
    faces by telling her not to - and using that as an excuse to talk about them."

    NLP stuff is bollocks, it's never been shown to have any effect.\r\n2. The UV
    pen trick was pretty clearly a standard magic trick. Not sure how he did it though.
    \r\n3. The sticking in the chair thing didn't work anyway. I bet it was just exploiting
    the 'getting out of bed' effect, where if feels as if you can't move but really
    you can."

  content: ! "The UV Pen trick wasn't anything more than typical derren brown suggestion.
    Did you heard how many time's he said two (in its phonetic form of to, too)..\r\nnot
    sure when he made the influence to which column she shoudl pick, but if you asked
    anybody what \"card 2\" would coordinate with, it'd probably be second from nearest
    to themselves, which is what she finally picked.\r\n\r\nhe's amazing at what he
    does, but the UV pen trick, much like the hour spent convincing the idiots in
    the world the power of crowds has any effect on guessing a completely random and
    unpredicatable outcome like the lottery, was just more amazing than telling the
    audience how he influenced her.\r\n\r\nthe human eye cant see the UV respondant
    ink, simply because it cant. otherwise you could see it. you could look at the
    paper all day and unless you could see it without the UV light (which you cant),
    the ink has no effect, because the brain, both subconcious and concious, only
    gets as much visual information as the eye gives it. \r\nwe dont have sonar either,
    and its like saying we are influenced by frequencies of sound that we cant hear.
    actually its not because we are because thats physical vibrations we have a chance
    of picking up on through nerves (bass notes, and that frequency that stops your
    organs working).\r\n\r\nCant wait to see DB live in april though. his proper live
    shows like a night of wonder and the gathering are so much better."

  content: That you allow it to be seem to be so simple along with your presentation
    even so discover this condition to become essentially an element that I find myself
    I'd personally by no means fully grasp. That sort of feels too complicated and
    intensely considerable in my opinion. Now i am looking toward your next article,
    Let me try to find the grasp of the usb ports!

<p>So, anyone watching the show was actually pretty much told (although indirectly) how it was done.</p>
<p>(Potential spoilers - see full post for my take)<a id="more"></a><a id="more-251"></a></p>
<p>Ok, the image with the flashing and the stuff, pretty noticable.  From what I know of the subject, it was meant to be.  What noone seems to have mentioned was the fact that as it flashed, there was a brief tone.</p>
<p>I believe that the image wasn't meant to actually be "subliminal" as he mentioned, "subliminal" images are "invisible".  It was meant to be noticed, but only to assosciate the tone with the image.</p>
<p>I also feel that the video did play a part.  From what I can tell, an image (or text) was over/underlayed over the image of the rotating (fuzzy) lines, but had a very high transparency.  This meant, that like the UV pen, you couldn't pick up the image conciously, but you could unconciously. (UV pens leave a small residue behind that makes visible light reflect slightly differently.  Try it, get a UV pen and write on a shiny surface. (like the back of a playing card). Looking head on at it, you don't notice, but if you tilt the card, you can see the writing at some angles - the mind subconciously picks this up).</p>
<p>Tie this in with things like the wording used before the video, the trailers, and hidden wording/images throughout the show, and you have your whole thing.  No "sublimilal" messages were used,  but there were many uses of whatever that term that he used was (SVP?)</p>
