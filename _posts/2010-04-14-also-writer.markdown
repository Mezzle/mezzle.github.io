  content: ! "I think the \"Google Ninja\" idea is something that many folks would
    enjoy reading for sure, especially as new tools open up web publishing to increasingly
    inexperienced and younger people (not to say those two are correlated, I'm referring
    to them as two distinct groups with some overlap).\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't really
    think that people would spend money for that in this day and age. That kind of
    information is becoming increasingly more available online these days. I realize
    what you're proposing would have a greater level of detail, but still -- you'd
    probably only get marginal sales from it. \r\n\r\nHaha, probably the most long-winded
    comment I've ever written."

<p>For those of you who don't know, I occasionally write for <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk">Linux Format</a>.  As I've got an article coming out in the next issue (available on April 29th), I thought I'd have a check to see if the PDF's are available in the subscribers area yet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they're not, however, I did notice that my first article for Linux Format has now been released to the general public.</p>
<p>If you head on over to <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/archives?issue=121">Issue 121</a>, you'll find my tutorial "Security: Protect your server" has a "<a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/includes/download.php?PDF=LXF121.tut_adv.pdf">Click here to read!</a>" link underneath it.</p>
<p>One of my other articles for them, "Super Snooper", has also <a href="http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-sniff-network-traffic-wireshark">found it's way onto TuxRadar</a>, and, while it doesn't have the pretty artwork (or a mugshot, or any mention of me, it seems!) that the magazine does, it's still well presented on the site!</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you've any feedback to either of them!</p>
<p>Along the same lines, I'm thinking that I want to write a book (mainly so that I'll eventually come <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Martin+Meredith">first in Google</a>, rather than what used to be second and now for some reason seems 7th :( ).  But what should I write about?  I've a few thoughts, and the one that I feel like I want to write the most is about "becoming a Google Ninja" (using Analytics, Website Optimiser, etc etc to their full potential) - but - I don't know - would people be interested in buying that?</p>
