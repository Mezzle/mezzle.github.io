  content: There is an option for launch feedback -- when you go to the properties
    of the launcher, there is an option for "Use Startup Notification".  I don't use
    it much, but it simply turns my cursor to the spinning wheel until the launched
    app starts up.  Hope that helps.

  content: I get that blank screen problem too, except not on my laptop, it's on my
    55 inch tv. After upgrading to feisty, I'm having some issues with my ati drivers,
    and I think it's due to that. It's an older ATI All-in-Wonder card, and it's only
    allowing me to choose between 640x480 and 740x480 (widescreen tv). I think the
    resolution is too low to show the grub screen and the (k/x)ubuntu loading screen,
    so it stays blank until it receives a signal it can use. I just set the Grub loader
    to display for 1 second, and ignore it for 30 seconds or so while it's booting.

  content: ! "Kudos to you for trying out Xubuntu!  It seems to me that there is no
    irc client installed because (1) not everyone will use an irc client, so why install
    one if the user does not plan to use it, and (2) there are many irc clients to
    choose from, so why not let the user install what they want instead of having
    extra software on the machine that does not get used.  This principle holds true
    for just about any software.  As for the lack of launch feedback, you're correct;
    however, generally, it should not take more than a few seconds for most applications
    to at least show some sign of launching.  If you are experiencing serious lag
    times, it may not be an issue with Xubuntu but might rather be an issue with a
    lack of system resources.  Even the 50 MB Damn Small Linux will experience lag
    times on really old (slow) machines.  Like with anything in life, Xubuntu has
    its limitations.  I'm not sure how old your machine is, but I have found that
    Xubuntu works well on P3's and newer, and 256  MB RAM is generally a good idea.
    \ For P2's, I have been using Fluxbuntu, which is even lighter-weight (currently
    only available in Dapper but soon to be offered with Feisty).  \n\nBeing a \"less-is-more\"
    kind of a guy, I really appreciate that Xubuntu doesn't come loaded down with
    a bunch of applications.  It allows me the freedom to install only what I want
    and not have a bunch of unused software taking up space or have to uninstall unwanted
    software.  It's nice that both KDE and Gnome libraries will run under Xubuntu.
    \ I also really enjoy that there is one \"Applications\" menu and everything can
    be found under that one menu.\n\nGood luck with your exploration of Xubuntu.  Hope
    that you like it as much as I do.  Cheers!"

  content: ! 'Dear Sir


    After reading your complaints I feel the need to point out a couple of things.


    1/ The issues with x would happen with all version of *buntu.  It''s an X/hardware
    issue and therefore harsh to blame the desktop.

    2/ Name Ubuntu''s irc client.  There isn''t one.  Why because Ubuntu is shipped
    with Gaim (now pidgin) which is a capable irc client.  In the same way as you
    can use Kopete as an irc client.  Yes there are better ones for all three desktops
    but I believe Kubuntu is the only desktop that includes one.  All the other need
    downloading.


    I would now like to congratulate you on dipping your feet into a desktop environment
    your not used to.  I had to install Kubuntu a number of times and ensure everything
    worked for the iso testing team.  It is hard as hell to come out of your comfort
    zone and use something different till you final figure out what''s what.  Once
    you get used to the differences you learn to live with the differences.'

    with some special screen (like my notebook TFT). I found a solution:\r\n\r\nInstall
    hwinfo and run it like this:\r\nhwinfo --framebuffer\r\n\r\nthis gives you the
    framebuffer modes available with your monitor (in hex) which are different from
    the modes you regularly use.. you can add a mode of your choice to /boot/grub/menu.lst
    like this:\r\n# defoptions quit splash locale=en_US vga=0x01F9\r\nif 0x01F9 is
    the mode you picked..\r\nsudo update-grub update the data and everything should
    work now.."

<p>So, this post is being written from Xubuntu.</p>
<p>As most of the people who know me will know, I'm a huge <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>/<a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> Fan. However, I've been sort of "donated" an old laptop to play around with for a while. And seeing as how old it is, I decided to install xubuntu on it.</p>
<p>I've only hit a few issues so far, so I'll outline them.</p>
<ul>
<li>I downloaded the Dapper ISO thinking that it was the Feisty one - this was probably a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebkac">PEBKAC</a></li>
<li>Feisty crashes X when trying to load a terminal (and probably other things, I reinstalled when I tried for the 13th time to open a terminal</li>
<li>When booting, between the grub loading and X starting, I just have a blank screen (I've heard this is an issue on laptops with *buntu though - so I don't know - It worked fine on my old laptop!)</li>
<li>No IRC client installed by default</li>
<li>Slow responsiveness (but it's faster thanit was in windows!)</li>
<li>No Launch Feedback - when I click an icon to run something, I don't know if it's actually running or whatever. This is a feature I sorely miss from KDE as I just ended up loading 5 file managers as I thought that it wasn't loading!)</li>
</ul>
<p>In general though, other than the points above, I'm finding Xubuntu a nice clean distro. Looks wise, I haven't had to change anything, as I do with kubuntu (what's with those squished title bar buttons?) and it all looks nice clean crisp and fresh.</p>
<p>It's a nice Distro. I think I may look at using it on some of my other machines in the future, even if it is GTK-app based, it's still a nice alternative.</p>
