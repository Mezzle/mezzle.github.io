  content: ! "Hello! \r\nInteresting application indeed. I am currently doing something
    even better than trying kettle, I'm developing a new KDE application similar to
    it. \r\n\r\nHow different it is from Automator? It seems to be like an Automator
    pro, or Automator Enterprise. The app I'm developing is heavily inspired in Automator
    and it's called RoboDo. Each action is a configurable plasmoid. Well, it's still
    in very early development stage, I've actually been developing it only for some
    days :P. The code is in http://gitorious.org/robodo/\r\n\r\nIs Kettle open source?
    Does it work in linux? Is there a .deb for it? :P"

  content: ! "Kettle looks awesome - ETL tools are normally ultra-expensive and closed-source
    so this is a fantastic project. Thanks for highlighting it.\r\n\r\nAlthough we
    don't use Kettle (yet) where I work we use a very similar ETL tool to extract
    application access rights from the systems and run an automatic comparison against
    the official records of who has been granted what. This reconciliation was previously
    being done manually in a spreadsheet and was both time-consuming (often measured
    in months for some of our more complex apps where there are thousands of access
    permissions and thousands of users) and error-prone. With the Kettle-like tool,
    we now have an automated process that we run on a daily basis to perform the reconciliation
    across around 40-50 apps and push an email with any exceptions out to the appropriate
    part of the business for review. The ETL tool means that we don't have to worry
    about the database being used as this is all managed for us. \r\n\r\nWe also use
    it to produce a great deal of reporting for senior management as it can help deal
    with some of the complexity of pulling information from multiple systems, transforming
    it into a common format and then pushing the resulting data into a database where
    where the reporting app can query it."

  content: ! "I love Kett^H^H Pentaho Data Integration, too. I once used Jitterbit
    for ETL, but as i ran into problems with the 3.0 Version of Jitterbit, i searched
    for something new, and found Talend and Pentaho.\r\nBoth look quite similar, and
    use a different approach than Jitterbit. Jitterbit is easier to use in the beginning,
    but Talend and Pentaho are so much more powerful, that once you took the beginner
    hurdle, you can do so much with it.\r\nThe decision for Pentaho was mostly because
    of my most loved integration step \"synchronise after merge\".\r\nJust wanted
    to leave my opinion here."

<p>Transforming data is hard. When I joined my current company, there were stupendous amounts of Perl/PHP/Bash/&lt;insert random programming language here&gt; scripts that would run on a cron job and do magic things to our data. They'd create reports, they'd tell the purchasers when we were running out of stock, they'd synchronise data between our Frontend and backend databases, they'd collect, they'd collate, they'd do everything and anything.</p>
<p>Except, with all these scripts, in all these random languages, written by a multitude of previous developers (at different skill levels), they weren't particularly maintainable (and sometimes, they weren't particularly readable or understandable either - imagine a 6000 line perl script that pretty much ran different permutations of the same data over and over again)</p>
<p>Enter Pentaho, and specifically it's "<a href="http://kettle.pentaho.org/">Kettle</a>" project. (since renamed "Pentaho Data Integration"), a tool that lets you manipulate your data in pretty much any way you can imagine, in the simplest and easiest way imaginable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Kettle in action" src="http://files.sourceguru.net/kettle.png" alt="" width="400" height="297" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's right, it's a GUI for data manipulation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know a lot of you are probably sceptical right now.  The first time I ever saw this was when a previous boss of mine put it forward as a potential solution for one of our problems (getting our orders from the front end database down to the office/warehouse).  I saw it, and I thought "GUI? Nah, that's not how real programmers do things!", so after the development team put forward another proposal to solve this, and it got accepted, I thought I'd never see the thing again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That was until my current boss started playing with it, trying to work out what it was doing so that he could get these evil GUI based scripts into something manageable, like nice, pretty code.  Thing s, when my boss plays with things that he doesn't know about, he tends to read up, research, and, 9 times out of 10, change his mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We wiped the previous server (it was rather noisy! We're glad it's no longer switched on!) and set up a new server to house our "BI platform".  Starting off with a few scripts, my boss learnt to love this tool, and then, as I'm his "2nd in command" (aka general lackey) - started making me learn how to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Again, I was sceptical, I didn't want to learn, and I put up resistance, but my boss was going away for nearly a month, and by this time, a few of our key business processes relied on Kettle, so, grudgingly, I sat down, and started to learn.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may be wondering now, why I started off this story talking about all those magical and wonderful scripts that no one seemed to know the inner workings of.  These scripts, as I've already mentioned were unwieldy, and at times, god-damned awful.  The plan was to move them to the BI system (as my boss had been doing already).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like to think of Kettle as a bridge between the process-flow diagram, and the code.  I started converting these scripts, and I was astonished by the fact that most of the conversions I was doing was converting a long perl script into 3 or 4 "Integration steps"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm totally besotted with this program now.  Any time I have to do data manipulation, I turn to it.  I can't describe how (once you've got used to it's quirks) easy it is to use, how simple it is, and how much it just makes sense. Best of all, most of those evil scripts are gone now, and replaced with "pretty" diagrams that do the work for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have to play with large data sets on a regular basis, I urge you to try it out.  You can buy me a beer for reccommending it next time you see me at $conference.</p>
