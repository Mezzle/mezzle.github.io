  content: ! "You know what would be cool? If you could persuade the Format people
    to offer a PDF subscription so us Americans don't have to shell out $150/year
    for a 12 month subscription.\r\n\r\nSeriously!\r\n\r\nBut, hey congrats on getting
    published. I've flipped through LF @ Barnes &amp; Noble and really like the zine."

  content: LOL. We're still in june, so I figured that the july issue should be the
    "correct" one xD. Well, at least, this proves that I'm not going blind

<p>For all those who can, I'd urge you to pick up a copy of Linux Format tomorrow.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I pitched an article to the editor of <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a> and it was accepted. Tomorrow, the magazine will be on the shelf. While I've already seen the PDF for the article, I'm going to be up early to make sure I can get my hands on the physical copy. For some reason, it won't seem real until I can run the paper through my fingers and smell the ink.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak preview:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Way back in the early days of dial-up, the internet mostly contained library catalogues, military secrets, and students' Dungeons and Dragons spec sheets.  Now there are websites for people, their pets, their friends and family, and their businesses.  However, while most people are happy to use a free hosting provider, or to pay a company to host their websites for them, the more dedicated web master tends to plump up for a dedicated server, or a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>
<p>Running your own server means that you have to be aware of the multitude of potential security issues you're exposed to on the internet, though.  These days, most home computers have a firewall in place, or connect through a router that can protect them from the dangers lurking on the web.  If you own a server, you'll still need a firewall, but there's much more you can do to be safe online and we'll show you how.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that anyone who reads the article in full will find it useful, and please, do send me feedback if you've read it!</p>
<p>The big question now is, what do I pitch for my next article?</p>
