  content: I'm a big fan of the `pidof` command and the killall command myself.  They
    make life much easier than gifuckingantic shell constructs with tons of pipes
    for no reason.

    What I have to come to appreciate a lot is replacing with sed (very helpful when
    e.g. dist-upgrading):

    sed -i s/foo/bar/ file'

    You get the number of images per focal length, sorted by length. If you want a

    or some other spreadsheet and graph it.'

<p>So, helping someone with an issue earlier (amarok had crashed and they couldn't kill it properly), I told them to issue the following command</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ps x | awk '/amarok/ {print $1}' | xargs kill -9</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this is a command I use a lot to kill programs that are being evil (generally, I use it to kill evolution!)</p>
<p>But the comment came back "That's nifty!"</p>
<p>So I've got to ask, what are your favourite "nifty" commands? and what do they do?</p>
<p><strong>&lt;edit&gt;</strong>  So far, within 5 mins of posting this, I've had 2 people ask why I don't just use killall</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mez@apathy:~$ ps x -ocommand | grep [e]vo
evolution
/usr/lib/evolution/evolution-data-server-1.12 &lt;snip&gt;
/usr/lib/evolution/2.12/evolution-exchange-storage &lt;snip&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
