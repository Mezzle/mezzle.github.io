<p>So, yes, a lot of things have forced my hand, and I now have to be in Wolverhampton tonight, at the pub, to try and find an overnight home for 2 Laptops :D Hopefully it wont be that hard to do!</p>
<p>Other than that, i've got to say, I love the FLOSS community just for the simple fact that so far I've had three people offer me a lift. Well, I'm still stuck on who I'll be taking it off, trying to whizz round and organise everything, but one way or another, I'll be there tomorrow @ 9.</p>
<p>That's if I don't pass out from alcohol poisoning tonight.</p>
<p>I must say, someone remind me tonight to take the piss out of whatever Aq decides to drink, just for comparing me to his granny last year ;) (and that winky was for Jono!)</p>
<p>If you read this, come say hi to me at some point. I'll probably be wearing a nametag tomorrow, but, to be fair,you're probably reading this through one or another of the planets, and they all have Gotchi's</p>
<p>I may look strange, but I'll be recognisable.</p>
