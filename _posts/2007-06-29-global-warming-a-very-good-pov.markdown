    This guy has good intentions but a fallacious premise. There''s very little doubt
    that anthropogenic climate change is real. Of course, the precise magnitude of
    the change (like weather itself, or any other chaotic system) are not easily predicted,
    but reasonable estimates exist.


    Those with an interest in the status quo are working quite hard to highlight this
    ''lack of hard numbers'' and misrepresent it as doubt in the existence of climate
    change. News outlets dutifully pass on the FUD because a controversy is more interesting
    and pleasant than general dread about the future--i.e. it sells better.


    If real effort was made at enforcing journalistic responsibility, two birds could
    be killed with one stone. Foot-dragging pundits would no longer be able to ''creatively
    interpret'' science, and the general public would be soundly convinced of the
    need to act.'
