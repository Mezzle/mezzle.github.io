    after you got the new card, though.

  content: ! "Martin, just a word of caution...\r\n\r\nsome compressed air is highly
    static-charged, which can be extremely dangerous as you know, to your pc innards.
    I recommend a fine paintbrush, as it removes more dust more effectively, without
    spreading it around so much. Best brushes are natural hair (horse/boar).\r\n\r\nI
    have seen orange dust before where there was a problem with sawdust. So I suggest
    checking for borer beetle / termite/ someone cutting wood nearby."

<p>Yes, that toything. Hehe.</p>
<p>Ok, so after one of my Flatmates decided to tread on my wireless dongle (which I had trailing on a long USB cable down the stairs outside my room so I could actually pick up the signal!) and break it, I haven't used my Desktop machine in a good few months. It was pretty much of a case of without internet access, it was pretty useless other than for watching DVDs on :) (which is when I'd boot it up) - so I used my eeePC instead.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went out and bought a nice new PCI Wireless card today - no chance of it being trodden on. And I got a nice one with 2 aerials, for connectivity purposes (and I can say - it's boosted my signal from what was on average 15% on the wireless dongle to on average 65%!)</p>
<p>I'm happy and actually surprised that Ubuntu picked it up straight away, and even used the settings from my old Wireless dongle to connect straight away!</p>
<p>Anyway, after a while, I hardlocked.... :( I hate hardlocking... tis so annoying. So I rebooted into the Hardy Installer CD (This still has Gutsy on) and tried an install... Another hardlock...</p>
<p>Uh-Oh I thought .... and ran memtest86+ - no problems... Try again.. another hardlock.</p>
<p>Ok, reopen PC to see if wiggling the wires does something.... OW! I burnt my hand...</p>
<p>My PC was <strong>seriously</strong> overheating.. :( So - I had a look - MY PSU and CPU fans were clogged up with orange dust. :'( damnit.</p>
<p>So I took a walk down to <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/">Maplin</a> and went and got myself some compressed air... Something I'd learnt from my IT Technician days was a godsend for cleaning CPU Fans.</p>
<p>Anyway, My PC is now sparkly and shiny inside, and on a plus, I've gotten rid of the annoying rattle it's had for the past year... I thought it was the CD drive... as it would always stop when I whacked the CD drive (another trick I learnt as an IT Technician!)</p>
<p>So yeah - I'd suggest that any geek out there goes and invests in a can of compressed air (or '<a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=28999&amp;criteria=airduster&amp;doy=3m7">airduster</a>' as it seems to be branded these days) - It <strong>is</strong> the magic computer fixing tool... if it can't be fixed with compressed air, (and/or wiggling the cables) you might as well replace it - it'll save you time and stop you banging your head against the wall</p>
<p>I just wish I'd thought and taken photos of how dusty it was (It was orange dust too - which was strange... I think the dust puppy's are becoming Ubuntu themed)</p>
