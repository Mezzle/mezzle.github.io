  content: What version of firefox was that? I use firefox frome Ubuntu Dappper (1.5.0.1?)
    and for me that works.  That aside, there used to be an extention to firefox which
    gave you a closebutton on each tab instead of one to the right.  That should give
    you the same amount of workload for closing a tab.    :)

  content: ! "I know how you feel. I find middle clicking tabs to close them a way
    more useful than pasting a URL from clipboard.\r\nIt's still possible to get that
    functionality by typing about:config to Firefox addressbar and searching \"middlemouse.contentLoadURL\"-line.
    Just set that line to false by double-clicking and now you can enjoy old good
    middle click funtionality.\r\n\r\nThis funtionality is enabled as default in Windows
    but not in Linux because of different behaviour of operating systems. In Linux
    it's common to paste things with a middle click and e.g. my friend prefers Firefox's
    default functionality (middle click paste URL) because it's more logical."

  content: For me, I've always had to install the tab preferences extension; I've
    never had this feature (that I can remember) even with the original alpha and
    beta builds. Of course, the tab preferences extension is still an option. Middle
    click is enabled by default.

  content: I know how that feels. I was so used to to right clicking a mail and clicking
    on filter email (or some such option) that when they removed that option, I was
    also kind of lost. Though, I got used to the ctrl+y also pretty soon, but thats
    not the point.

  content: By the way, the "new" behavior (middle click pastes URL) has been the upstream
    default on Linux forever.  The behavior you prefer (middle click closes tab) is
    the upstream default on Windows.  Ubuntu patches their packages to use the Windows
    default instead of the Linux default.  Did you switch from an Ubunut package to
    one from a different source?

    your hands off the keyboard.

<p>Isn't it annoying when you use an app for about a year - and then they go and upgrade, and remove one of the useful shortcuts that you've always used?</p>
<p>The reason I first decided not to use konqueror as my primary Web browser was the fact that when I middle clicked a tab, it didn't close the tab - but tried to open whatever was in your clipboard as a URL. I found this very... very annoying...</p>
<p>Now, firefox has gone and changed and does the same thing - so now I have no way of quickly middle clicking a tab to close it. Which just ... p**ses me off. It's the thing in firefox that always saved me the most time. I'm very annoyed at losing this functionality - but meh - I guess I have to live with it.</p>
