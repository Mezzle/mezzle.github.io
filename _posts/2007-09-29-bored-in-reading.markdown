<p>Ok, so I moved to Reading last Sunday to start a job here... I'm now working with <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a> as a developer... which is cool.. and uber and stuff, cause it's the kind of Job I went to University to get into (before I dropped out because of debt!)</p>
<p>However, now it's the weekend, I'm not at work, and have nothing to do and noone to do it with.</p>
<p>Ah well, time to drink my vodka and then go invade the local Rock Bar :D</p>
