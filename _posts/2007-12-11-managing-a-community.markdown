  content: Yep, that's how it works sometimes. Leadership is difficult and sometimes
    leaders are treated unfairly. There are times you have to have strong shoulders,
    a thick skin, and a willingness to choose not to answer an accusation in kind.
    My hope is that I can live above the base accusations, and give a kind, gentle,
    and reasonable response to the more logical objections.
