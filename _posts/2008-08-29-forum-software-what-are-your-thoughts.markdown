  content: ! "Not sure about what you mean for abstracted Api.\r\nAs the main issue
    with forums is integrating them with your other existing websites I'd like to
    have good plugin architecture. \r\nSo you could plug-in an alternative Users datastore,
    alternative users login etc.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the user's authentication
    and storing (which db table, which fields, etc) is the main issue.\r\n\r\nThen
    follows last post local/remote retrieval, thread retrieval, thread posting etc,
    but that's more easy usually."

    SOA/ROA/RESTful manner and include built-in WSDL support.\r\n2) Should be written
    in C/C++ (FAST!!) and support dynamically loadable plug-ins using an abstracted
    core. (NOTE: C/C++ is the least important of the requirements) (NOTE2: I'd prefer
    C++)\r\n3) Should produce valid _and semantic_ HTML or XHTML (depending on the
    capability of the browser).\r\n4) Should support CSS style-sheets.\r\n5) Should
    not produce different pages for different browsers (except in the aforementioned
    HTML/XHTML switch, though they shouldn't be very divergent).\r\n6) Should support
    OpenID user registration."

  content: ! "A modular API with plugins seems like a great way to go, but the problem
    with modular hooks is that they're not good for performance.  You get all these
    calls.  What I'd like to see is a series of plugins/modules/addons that are more
    like patches.  Have people write a bunch of mods, but instead of calling them
    with hooks, install them like a standard diff/patch, so in the end, you're not
    killing performance.  It would be nice to have a repository of modules/patches/addons,
    to keep track of which ones you've installed, which ones conflict with one another,
    and how to resolve those conflicts.  When you keep track of which ones you have
    installed, you can uninstall them with ease.\r\n\r\nAlso, look at something like
    phpbb which needs to run in all kinds of languages.  That is great since the whole
    world can use it, but for almost all use-cases, the forum itself with operate
    with one language.  Why have all the language hooks?  I'd prefer to see a diff
    file that targets all the strings.  People can translate that diff file, but the
    end product uses direct strings rather than look up the version.\r\n\r\nDo the
    same thing with themes/templates.  Instead of dynamically creating the page more
    with the template, use a diff again.  Each theme is a diff from vanilla, and you
    can revert the diff to go back to vanilla, and then install another theme.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, your page generation times will be less, and there will be fewer DB calls.
    \ Performance goes through the roof."

  content: ! "I'd like to addon to previous comments.  I know just enough PHP and
    SQL to get myself in trouble, but I'd love to develop a truly superb forum software
    package for personal use.  I'm all for keeping it OSS and letting others benefit.
    \ I don't have the skills to start anything from scratch and what I'm looking
    at doing is taking something like phpbb3, installing mods, integrating gallery2,
    integrating wordpress and then trying to streamline it for performance.  As phpbb3
    continues development, I'd try to patch in diffs from their latest branch.\r\n\r\nI
    want something very much feature rich in what it provides, while not dogging on
    performance.  If you take a look at something like phpbbfm, not only is it gaudy
    (poor choice of modules they've added) you get horrid performance.  They go nuts
    on SQL calls for useless features.\r\n\r\nLastly, the other big thing is to make
    _good_ use of AJAX features.  Why do all forums still use an ancient interface?
    \ Don't add eye candy that offers no real improvement, but why not utilize stuff
    like lightbox for images, ajax pop-up search boxes, auto-complete, etc?  PMs should
    also be ajax pop-ups as opposed to pop-up windows.  You should be able to drag
    the interface of the forum around, close down a section, open another up, etc.
    \ Reduce page-loads and allow a customizable interface that users will enjoy."

  content: ! "I'm no developer and couldn't build my own forum script however I do
    run a couple of vBulletin based forums which seems to be the best out there currently,
    I can understand the reason why Ubuntu Forums runs on vB. My preference for forum
    software goes like this: vBulletin &gt; MyBB &gt; phpBB. \r\n\r\nHaving worked
    alot with just about all forum package except for IPB the following things seem
    to be missing or poorly implemented.\r\n\r\nTemplating System: In most forum packages
    everything is controlled by templates which a first look is a great idea, however
    once you customize the template, which nearly everyone does as who wants to run
    a board? version upgrades especially major upgrades bring all kinds of headaches
    and many templates that have to manually edited. I have no ideas on how to overcome
    this short coming but something should be done. \r\n\r\nUpgrades: If your software
    frequently releases updates, it should be able to auto update itself or at least
    download the package on it's own and let the user actually run the upgrade. None
    of this download the package from one site, decompress it, and overwrite the server
    side files via FTP. It's time consuming busy work. \r\n\r\nAdd-ons: It would be
    nice if addons were easier to install again I'd be very happy if I never had to
    see another FTP client. :D\r\n\r\nThanks for listening,\r\nDan"

    \  Many of them know which threads I've read, but in long threads I have no clue
    what page to visit to start today where I left yesterday.  Many of the last read
    threads are based on when I last visited the forum as a whole, and not the thread
    itself, which is annoying in itself.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see a NNTP interface to
    I can use a better client than a web browser as well.  (This would take care of
    the other problems), but it appears that this is a much harder problem than I
    would think as I've never seen it."

  content: A long time ago I did start to make my own forum with certain ideals and
    structures but I never finished it, the plan was to make a forum that was very
    simple, for users that didn't know a lot about how forums and other webapps function,
    it would be almost not customisable (only with a css file) to make things even
    easier. It would have the basic function that all forums have but nothing extra,
    no plugins or whatever. I thought that people who don't know a lot about webdesign
    could use it for an easy forum and also system admins and that kind of people
    for quick forums that don't need a lot of administration.

  content: ! "What I mean by an abstracted API is so that, for example, another application
    can automatically link into the system, so they can, for example, have all their
    session and user management stuff done by calling\r\n\r\nSession::LoadUser();\r\n\r\nor
    similar, meaning that the base core components are there for anyone to use.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking along the lines of a Framework style thing, however, most of the frameworks
    out there don't go as far as that, (eZc being a noted exception) as far as I'm
    aware, and just put an abstraction on the bits that you'd use to put together
    something (form creation, input cleaning, etc etc) - whereas what I'm thinking
    of would go a step further, so that you can easily include all the functionality
    of the forums with a simple call, and have the backend use it, so you don't have
    to do special code checks to see if a user is logged in, or if a user has a special
    permission. You just call\r\n\r\nUser::is_admin();\r\n\r\nAnd that lets you know
    whether the user is an admin, displays a login form (from the main app) if there
    is one needed, etc etc.\r\n\r\nMichael, as much as C++ is great, it's not the
    easiest thing to write a web-app in.\r\n\r\nRegarding automated update. While
    it'd be nice, it's not particularly feasible.. :( Things being broken, etc etc.
    \r\n\r\nI think regarding automated updates, something along the lines of Bzr
    would work well for that, espescially if you have local modifications.\r\n\r\nActually,
    come to think of it, bzr would be great for add-ons etc etc. You could just\r\n\r\nbzr
    merge http://location/to/some/cool/feature\r\n\r\nAnd then it'd set it all up
    for you..."

  content: ! "Interesting topic!\r\n\r\nI have an IT (all mainframe) background. Once
    upon a time back in the mid eighties, myself and two other guys working through
    a consulting company designed and developed a â€œVariable Clinical Studiesâ€\x9D
    system for American Optical in western Massachusetts. That system was CICS/COBOL
    driven and contained a user control screen much the same as you see in vB software
    but, it was much more detailed/complex in terms of the creation of a clinical
    studies system, which of course would vary from study to study.\r\n\r\nThe primary
    user, usually a doctor, would define what the system screens, reports, and maintenance
    criteria IE: batch updates, backups of data files etc., would consist of. Basically
    that included everything, such as all calculations to achieve the desires results,
    how the screens would appear on the end users terminal, and all hard copy reports
    generated by the system - directly from the user control screen, which we would
    call a control panel today.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, that would be the ultimate forum
    software of the day! If I can ever get to the point of understanding xml, php,
    javascript, blah, blah, blah, I intend to write such a software system. For now
    though, I'm just trying to get a vB board up and running. The test version of
    that board will be the foundation I'll use to create the beast mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI've
    only been working on learning all this new stuff for about 2 years so don't expect
    anything soon, HA!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNita"

<p>Having worked for two different competitors in the Forum Software Market, and watching over the last few months at the ranting and raving about the incompetency of these companies and others (Not by me, but by others - I can't (for legal reasons) express my personal opinions regarding them) It's led me to ask the question.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were to write your own, perfect Forum Software, what features would it have, and what would be "special" about it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I'd like to see a Forum System that had an abstracted API at it's core, so addon features could be added nicely. I'd also like to see that it'd be a RESTful system (or at least work in a Resource Oriented Architectural Manner)</p>
<p>So, tell me your thoughts...</p>
