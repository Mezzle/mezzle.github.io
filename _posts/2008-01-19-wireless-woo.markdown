    I don''t know if it''s up to date, please correct it if you can. Gutsy ships with
    the rt73usb modules so things are supposed to work out of the box. A quick search

<p>Hehe. As I'm moving soon, and I'm only going to have wireless internet, I thought I'd sit down and have a look to see whether the D-Link USB adapter I've had for about 2 years would actually work with Linux, which, while it had previously picked up details of the networks, never seemed to work.</p>
<p>After reading through a couple of Ubuntu Wiki Pages, I managed to download, compile and install the working module - and guess what - it works!</p>
<p>Now this is great news - I won't have to go out and search for a new Wireless Dongle/Card, and well - seeing as the end of my ethernet cable is missing the clip, and keeps falling out of the router, I can now use wireless! woohoo! (and it's even working with WPA!)</p>
<p>Oh, and hello <a href="http://planet.bitfolk.com/">Planet #bitfolk </a></p>
