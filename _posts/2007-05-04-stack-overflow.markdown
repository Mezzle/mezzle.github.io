  content: That cartoon is hilarious and I too cannot stand Vista. I never had the
    joy of running Vista on any of my computers, but my Dad currently has it and I
    am constantly having to fix issues.  Thanks for sharing!

  content: Agree with Brandon here. Vista is too much of a headache. XP is still okay.
    Haven't yet thought about ubuntu though.

  content: Does this go with saying that Vista has not made any attempt at improving
    or enhancing how it operates that issues with it are still being talked about,
    even to the point of making a comic strip of it? Where did all the billions go?
