<p>The other day, I walked into a local computer shop as I needed to buy a few components, after a while, I got chatting to the Sales Girl, and the talk moved to Linux. she said she was trying out linux on her laptop, and I asked her what she was using</p>
<p>"Oh, 'K-ubuntu'"</p>
<p>"Really? I help with the development of that" <em>(not true of late - but hey!)</em></p>
<p>"Wow - I've met someone famous"</p>
