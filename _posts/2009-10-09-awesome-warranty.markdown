  content: Skullcandy's warranty is amazing. My Full Metal Jackets have failed twice,
    and they replaced them both times at no charge. I didn't need a receipt or anything
    like that, I just cut off the jack and mailed it in. The first time they even
    overnighted them to me free in Hawaii.

  content: ! "You just mailed the jack in?\r\n\r\nInteresting - that seems like a
    quick and easy way to scam them if you don't mind wiring up your own jack!"

<blockquote>If this product should fail in your lifetime, we will replace it at no charge. If the proeducts is damaged by aggressive music listeners sliding a rail, sliding down the emergency ramp of your aircraft, slammed in your locker, slammed in your car door, run over by a car, running into a wall, getting run out of town, mountain biking, road biking, sky diving, beating your boyfriend unmercifully, getting beat down by the man, blown up in an accidental experimentation with flammable substances or damaged in any other every day experience, it means you are living your life the way we want our product used! In these, or any other damaging events, we will replace the product for a 50% discount from retail.</p></blockquote>
