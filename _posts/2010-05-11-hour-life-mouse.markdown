  content: I'm guessing I would just have one really big dot and a few lines here
    and there. I find the mouse to be to cumbersome to get real work done...

<p>A mini-meme that has been spreading round the IT team at my workplace is "<a href="http://iographica.com/">IOGraph</a>" - a small Java program that tracks and draws the status of your mouse over a period of time.  Lines are movement, circles are places where the mouse has stopped...  The bigger the circle, the longer it was there.  I have 2 monitors, which explains the weird dimensions!</p>
