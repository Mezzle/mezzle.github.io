    stereo, or route the sound differently dependant on a\r\nswitch state.\r\n\r\nThough
    it does fix one major issue. I'm sure if I knew more about\r\nelectronics, I could
    come up with a really nice Circuit Diagram from\r\nthis to do what I need it to
    do.... though working with 2 channels,\r\nkeeping the potentiometers in sync with
    each other, etc etc... \r\n\r\nIt's a start though"

  content: ! "It would help if you could write what are your \"capabilities\" with
    electronics.\r\n\r\nIf you get a circuit diagram, can you build the circuit?\r\n\r\nThe
    circuit shouldn't be a problem.\r\n- The surround: you can use a summing op. amp.
    so you get \"stereo\" from surround (no need for potentiometers here)\r\n- Mixer:
    another summing op. amp. with potentiometers so you can regulate the volume of
    every source\r\n- output selection: you can use a simple switch to switch between
    the speakers and headphones\r\n\r\nYou can get \"stereo\" potentiometers for volume
    control and \"stereo\" switch for output selection. You can also use \"stereo\"
    switches to enable/disable sources."

    out what vendor it is from and where to get it since we have big school holidays
    until september here in Austria. The surround sound is likely to be problematic,
    because the box I know only can handle stereo sound from single 3,5 mm Jacks,
    but maybe there are other models that can cope with surround sound. Oh, and it
    also doesn't have any mixer, you can just switch between the different sound sources.\r\n\r\n
    I'll post again here as soon as I found out where to get these boxes."

  content: ! "It seems that I haven't made it clear.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to be able
    to do is mix down several inputs (one of them is 3 inputs for Surround Sound).
    I then need to be able to switch those inputs from my Surround System to my headphones.\r\n\r\nI
    already have a mixer, however, this only deals with Stereo, not with surround
    sound... While I could mix everything from the surround down to stereo, pass through
    the mixer, then back out to \"fake\" surround from the mixer, I don't want to
    do this, I want proper surround sound being sent to the surround sound, with the
    stereo mixed in. It's not really an easy thing to do, and would probably need
    something custom made.\r\n\r\nPlus, you have the fact that generally, your difference
    between control room and master out for mixers would mean that you'd have to press
    several buttons to actually switch everything. While this is nice as you can select
    some items for speakers, and some for headphones... It's not exactly what I want
    to do."

  content: ! "Crazy suggestion but how about using your mixer to mix the stereo sources
    and pass the result into the AUX input on your sound card and use the sound card
    for output.\r\n\r\nThis way you'll have all stereo sources premixed via the mixer
    and still be able to retain the surround from the sound card.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you could use the multiple CD/AUX inputs into your sound card directly and use
    the sound card's mixer to mix the sources. I'm not sure how many sources exactly
    that you'd like to input but most sound cards these days can handle at least 2
    to 3 input sources between the external jacks and the internal plugs (you may
    need to create a custom adapter to convert the 3.5mm jack to a 4-pin CD-style
    connector)."

    Wanted: Custom Audio Solution Â« Source Guru...'
permalink: wanted-custom-audio-solution

<p>This is a sort of "Dear LazyWeb" post.</p>
<p>As I'm moving to a new place on sunday, I'm going to have some restrictions on when I can use loudspeakers (so as to not disturb other people), but at the moment, I've got a few places where I'm using different audio sources, for example, when I'm using my PC, I might be either playing music through my PC, listening to the DAB Radio I have in the background, watching TV at the same time, etc etc.</p>
<p>What I need (want) is a solution so that I can have a box on my desk which allows me to select from a range of inputs, and flick between outputting to the speakers, or to headphones.</p>
<p>While at the moment, every item I have seperate speakers. My Surround has 4 inputs (1 aux, 3 for surround - all 3.5mm Jacks) and my headphones have a single 3.5 mm jack.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do is be able to wire the following into a box, and then have a button to switch between using the speakers on the surround, and the headphones.</p>
<ul>
<li>PC - 3 3.5mm Jacks for surround</li>
<li>Laptop - Single 3.5mm Jack</li>
<li>DAB Radio - single 3.5mm Jack</li>
<li>TV - single 3.5mm Jack</li>
<li>Mixer - currently going through PC, but has 2 x Mono 1/4" jacks out (which I've already converted to a single 3.5mm Jack at the other end)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like it if I could listen to multiple resources at the same time. However, at the moment, I think that the main issue is going to be converting the Surround into stereo for the headphones... The single 3.5 Jacks can be output to the "Aux" channel...</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone knows of any solutions for this, or wants to help me build one (anyone good with creating circuit diagrams) - and I'm sure there'll be issues with different sources.</p>
<p>I mean, I could probably just pipe all but the surround through the mixer... and then use the headphone override on the speakers, but I don't really want to have the issue of plugging and unplugging the headphone jack all the time. I'd rather just hit a button.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
