  content: ! 'Me? I''m still in a bit of shock. As a long time NetWare guy, Microsoft
    has been the Darkside for a very long time. Announcements like this take a guy
    from left field. Oof.


    That said, you do raise some good points. Also keep in mind that this agreement
    is for five years, and any protections now in place may expire at that time. Any
    ''mutually infringing'' patent issues that arise during this period that aren''t
    subsequently licensed may end up in another flury of lawsuits. The patent protection
    clause(es) indemnify against any undiscovered/prosecuted existing infringements,
    but doesn''t specify the state of any future items.


    I have to expect that there will be some technical leakage out of Novell''s OSS
    guys into the broader Linux/Opensource community as a result of this. I saw specific
    mentions of Samba in the marketing materials so far, which is encouraging. I''m
    remembering a sign on one of the Samba sites that if you''ve signed a specific
    MS agreement, you can''t work on Samba dev. Perhaps they''ll recind that, and
    Samba will become more palatable to me. Won''t know until we get some years under
    our collective belts.


    The three items, Virtualization, eDir/AD compatibility, and document format compatibility,
    all have their places but Virtualization is the one that grabbed my attention.
    Longhorn is supposed to have virtualization built in, Novell has Xen. And VMWare
    is what passes for the 800lbs gorilla in this market (will we see them at BrainShare
    this year?), this competes directly with that. I expect one of the early gains
    will be Xen-packaged Windows installs that''ll work much better out of the box.


    All that being true, Red Hat has taken some real blows lately. How they respond
    to it, and most importantly how their userbase responds to it, will be the real
    teller.'

  content: ! 'This dealt me a huge WTF when I got the Reuters Alert in my Inbox this
    morning. I have worked for the "evil empire" in the past, and I watched partnerships
    of theirs dissolve. When this happens, the partner either goes out of business,
    or Microsoft absorbs them. With the current status of Novell''s financial situations,
    I don''t see them standing much ground in any event that Microsoft can throw at
    them.


    Look, most of us know that Microsoft doesn''t get into partnerships for the good
    of the community, it is always for the good of Microsoft. That is why Oracle gave
    them the finger and decided to pursue open source solutions years ago. I don''t
    think Microsoft looks at the Open Source community as a competitor, but more or
    less an enemy.


    I am not a total law buff, but my understanding that GPL licensing that is in
    effect as of the partnership is fine and out of the scope/grasp of Microsoft,
    but what about future applications? How strong is the GPL when it comes to the
    attorneys at Microsoft? I mean, what are my chances of saving face if I create
    and application, make it GPL, and Microsoft grabs it because of some fluke agreement
    between them and Novell? Am I screwed, or do I have a leg to stand on?


    Plus, everything they have committed to this partnership, could have been done
    without the partnership. That is why I don''t trust it. The whole office standard
    stuff has been an issue forever, however before this partnership, all of the XML
    stuff was already being worked on. As for the virtualization, and this whole thing
    of Linux running on Microsoft and Microsoft running on Linux is confusing as well.
    Microsoft talks about this virtualization, but recently let it be known that it
    will be illegal to run Vista virtually.


    Very skeptical on this entire thing. It just doesn''t feel right to me. Plus Steve
    Ballmer can''t pronounce Ubuntu correctly on TV either, so that makes me furious
    :) haha j/k! sysadmin1138 is right, we probably won''t know for a few years anyways.
    And what does happen come 5 years from today? Just a very strange day, for Microsoft
    to finally step up to Open Source so late in the ballgame. They recognized it
    for more than 10 years, and just now they are doing something. Argh I hate this
    sick feeling in my gut ;)'

  content: Well from what I have read so far, I've only seen marketing fluff. I don't
    expect Micosoft, after how hard they fought odf, and how much effort was put into
    reverse engineering doc to suddenly open of specs and let the gpl'ed openoffice
    work any better than it already does. I also don't expect Microsoft to suddenly
    throw engineers into samba development, when they can't even be bothered to show
    up to the international cifs conference. I guess I don't really understand what
    it means to allow their software to interoperate when we are talking about two
    different operating systems. Plus most of what SuSE ships is gpl'ed anyway. Thus
    any effort put into any of their products would be absorbed by the rest of the
    opensource community. As of now I can only call schanagins, and wait to see what
    actually transpires.

  content: ! 'I''m not active in any Open Source projects, and in cases like this
    it really shows. My key learnings are all in closed source operating systems and
    I''m slowly picking up how to do linux in the enterprise (at home is another story,
    12 years there so far and counting). I don''t know how OSS projects function on
    the inside.


    When I said that there would be some technical leakage, I meant that. It may not
    be legal, and it may not be above-board. But it''ll happen. Maybe a forked Samba
    that can''t be used by a company worried about lawsuits, but actually works better
    than ''official'' Samba. Again, won''t know until we see how these two behave
    in the next five years.

    <blockquote>But surely that technical leakage wont be covered by Novells agreement
    with Microsoft, and cause potential lawsuits against people like the OSDL (Microsoft
    only promised to not file against Individuals)</blockquote>

    That depends on what leaks, and how it is handled inside the various projects
    (closed and open). I see that Samba can do NTLMv2 these days, which I rather like.
    It took them a l-o-n-g time to get that support in there, presumably because MS
    has encumbered all documentation about the protocol so it had to be reverse engineered.
    This suggests to me that the protocol itself isn''t encumbered by patent protections,
    but the documentation about it is. If that is the case, and I''m not sure about
    that, then such technical leakage I described could carve potentially years off
    of the dev cycle. On the other hand, if the technology being developed is encumbered
    <i>en toto</i> then Samba developing the feature at all will get them sued; regardless
    of how the knowledge was aquired to build the feature in the first place.


    Novell has a history of arrogant strong-arming. It''s one of the reasons they
    missed the ball with Windows NT as much as they did. On the other hand, such reflexes
    are what you might call endemic in capitalist culture so it isn''t terribly surprising.
    The current Novell CEO was put in place as a result of a shareholder revolt, and
    <a href="http://www.novell.com/company/blogs/cmo/?p=33" rel="nofollow">as we''ve
    learned</a> this idea to talk with Microsoft came from the CEO. The fact that
    this deal strikes a lot of people as low-brow, ''protect the bottom line,'' stuff
    doesn''t surprise me at all in light of that fact.


    I just hope that Novell has an institutional memory for what happened LAST time
    they tried to get cheecky with their installed base. I also hope that the Linux
    community is limber enough to throw off the closed-source shackles that have arrived
    in the past month, potential or otherwise.


    Like I said above, how Red Hat handles all of this will be the real teller.'

    as that.


    Ask VIVO. Ask Real. Ask Stacker. Ask Symantec and McAfee. Ask Kodak. Ask the guy
    who invented the scroll mouse. Ask L H.


    So I''m with Admiral Ackbar on this one. Specifically, I think they want to get
    patented technology into Mono, wait for Novell Linux to become completely dependent
    on Mono, then either charge massive fees or blow it out of the water with a patent
    violation lawsuit.


    In fact, I''m seriously considering switching from Ubuntu to Kubuntu specifically
    because of the fact that ubuntu-desktop now requires Mono.'

  content: ! "If the linux community was based on trust, it would use the BSD license.
    \n\nIt isn't based on trust. It is based on a good-behavior enforcing license,
    the GPL. You don't get to choose wether you give back to the community.\n\nI would
    take patches and open-source stuff from the devil himself. \n\nSecondly, the target
    of Novell, the corporate world, has little to do with our commitment to freedom.
    I couldn't care less if they get a lousy deal. I don't see how these effects the
    groups of people we do care about: the nerds, the tweakers, the poor and the idealists.\n\nSecondly
    Microsoft isn't evil. It's is just playing by the rules. Don't like the rules?
    Blame the game, not the winner. You can expect people to have moral standards.
    But companies are not people. \n\nMost evil on this world takes place by spreading
    the responsibility. I'm just the lawyer I allow defend their rights in court.
    I'm just the programmer, I just make quality software. Guns don't kill people,
    people kill people. If I wouldn't do this job, somebody else will.\n\nIt are all
    lame excuses off course, but doing the right thing requires a form of welfare
    not all of us have. What are the sacrifices we, 'the good people' really make?
    \n\nWe need to change the game. Not blame the players. Novell and Microsoft teaming
    up, makes sense. I can't really tell wether or not this turns out to be good or
    bad thing for us, or their customers. But I do know It's gonna be a good thing
    for them. So them taking that route makes sense.\n\nChange the game."

    If they can choose between: -being split, -having a real closed source competitor

    will always be markets linux can''t serve (and visa versa).


    On the other hand they need to be very intelligent about what they are gonna do.
    If it means Novell is open-sourcing technology that is not free, because it violates
    MS patents, they they will see a lot of linux players separating themselves from
    it. They will be nothing more than another outside player.


    Although this would mean Novell can be the bridge between the free world and the
    MS-slavery world. First a company switches to Novell. Ten years later all MS products
    are gone, they can switch to Ubuntu.'

    right that the\ncommunity bans Novell from further using FOSS codes.  \n\nRemember,
    that one great advantage of Linux is the\nfreedom against \"vendor lock-in\".
    \ With Novell\nGNU/Linux flavors you are dealing with patented\ntechnology. Worse,

<p>First of all, before I start writing, I need to state the following.</p>
<p>This blog is published on Novell affiliated website(s) This post does in no way represent the view of Novell/Microsoft or any of their employees, and is only my own personal opinion on this subject.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't already read, Novell and Microsoft have entered into 3 agreements of Collaboration between the companies. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/faq.html">here</a> for more info</p>
<p>The  way I see it is yes, this is a good thing in general for Linux. With Microsoft actively participating in the collaboration between open source and Windows, it can only be a good thing, finally, we will be able to integrate Windows and Linux clients seamlessly, they'll work together, and everything will be groovy.</p>
<p>For SUSE Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>Yes, this will bring technical advances and help with the proliferation of Linux, undoubtedly, but - the way the Press Release and FAQ are written, it seems to me that Novell and Microsoft will be working hand in hand to exclude anyone outside their customer bases from using anything that will come from this collaboration.</p>
<p>Novell, up to this point to me have seemed to make huge steps into the Open Source Market, making a lot of contributions in lots of projects, but with this announcement, it now seems that they just want themselves to benefit, not the rest of the FLOSS community. Do we really want Novell to become the "Microsoft" of Linux? Monopolising on the things that are going to get the paying customers to use their Products? I remember a quote from an <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=326&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">interview with <strong>Novell's Greg Mancusi-Ungaro</strong></a> in LXF which was this</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, if we ever woke up one day and said 'Wow, Novell is the Microsoft of Linux' or 'Red Hat is the Microsoft of Linux', then the Linux movement would be over.</p></blockquote>
<p>I totally agree, but to me, it looks like this is a step in that direction for Novell.</p>
<p>By the way, feel free to flame me^W^Wcomment, I'd love to hear other people's opinions on this</p>
