<p>... that is the question.</p>
<p>Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
the slings and arrows of outrageous harrasments,<br />
or take ops against a sea of trolls,<br />
and by opposing, end them? To /part; to /quit;<br />
No more; and by a /quit say we end<br />
The head-ache, and thousand virtual pings<br />
That IRC is heir to, 'tis a consumation<br />
Devoutly to be wish'd. To /part; to /quit;<br />
To /quit, perchance to /ignore: ay, there's the rub;<br />
For in that /quit, what messages may come<br />
When we have shuffled off this virtual coil,<br />
Must give us pause, there's the respect<br />
That makes calamity of such low ping;<br />
For who could bear the whips and scorns of time?<br />
The operator's wrong, the users contumely<br />
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br />
The insolence of office and the spurns<br />
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his quietus make<br />
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
But that the dread of something after disconnection,<br />
That undiscover'd country from whose bourne<br />
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br />
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br />
And thus the native hue of resolution<br />
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br />
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br />
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br />
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!<br />
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br />
Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
