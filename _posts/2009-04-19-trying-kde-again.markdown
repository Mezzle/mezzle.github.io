  content: ! "@Markus\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that the transition period in Intrepid
    was rough, I feel that the situation has vastly improved with Jaunty. I installed
    the beta of Jaunty on a windows machine I had (using wubi no less!) and had amazing
    results with it. Setup time was nearly nothing compared to my normal Arch+KDEMod
    install and it had KDE4/Qt4 versions of almost all of the apps I need (no cross-major-release
    apps that look ugly and function weirdly because they're out of place)\r\n\r\nI'm
    quite excited for the final release of Jaunty, it's about time that Kubuntu got
    back on its feet :)"

  content: ! "@Wesley\r\nThis seems typical for me with KDE on kubuntu.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was on Hardy (that was the 4.0 KDE kubuntu right?) I started living off trunk
    KDE (4.0 wasn't pleasant), then on the switch to Intrepid I found that 4.1 wasn't
    quite as good as my builds but saved the effort for me. Then I got trunk withdrawal
    and started 4.2 on intrepid, then when there were packages for available I switched
    back but then I was having some major issues with playing videos and having desktop
    effects at the same time crashing KWin. I switched to jaunty alpha for something
    unrelated and found the 4.2 build in jaunty were just flying, no more kwin crashes
    (woot), makes me wonder if this is a good build for once or whether I should compile
    it myself and be amazed how it is even better :-D? But I am being optimistic ...
    or lazy ... one of the two.\r\n\r\nMy only real issue at the moment is when I
    try to send an email that is signed it tells me the passphrase is bad without
    letting me enter one. Is this a KDE bug or probably a kubuntu one? I not been
    able to find anyone else with the same issue so I am guessing kubuntu or I am
    just very unlucky.\r\n\r\nWhat other KDE distros would people recommend? I looked
    at arch but the install seemed like more effort than it was worth, am i wrong?"

    seemed half-assed.  I used to bounce between Mandriva and openSUSE (both damn
    good KDE distros, IMO), but the Build Service has be on SUSE full-time.  11.1
    ships with a well-done 4.1.x, there's a Build Service repo for 4.2.x (which I'm
    running now, and it's great), and another Build Service repo for /trunk snapshots.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know how things are on the Gnome side of the fence, but unless you really
    can't live without apt-get/aptitude, there are better options for KDE."

  content: I'm using KDE 4.2.2 under Arch and it's really amazing.  Well done, solid
    desktop.  You have to use a text installer and edit a few files manually to begin
    so following the guide is necessary.  It could be a bit thrown-off to a new user
    though but i think the rewareds are worth it.

    2009 Spring gets released end of this month. So far best KDE4 distribution what
    I have never used. (since 2009). I am currently on cooker (development version
    what gets updates all the time and it is now freezed) and I just love the KDE4
    functionality. My opinion is it goes even over OpenSUSE (what is mostly for gnome!).
    I am forced to have one computer in science labs to use OpenSUSE and all others
    are running Mandriva. We tested few times Kubuntu or just Ubuntu and we needed
    to turn those off because the quality is by some reason lower for what we need."

    I used Arch to set up a light-weight desktop with Openbox etc.  It was a lot of
    work for me because I wasn't that experienced but it was a superb learning experience
    and the more I use it as a distro the more I like it.  Also, pacman owns all others.

    but the second and subsequent times will be much easier."

  content: ! "I totally agree with you. Even though I switched from KDE to gnome a
    little earlier (with ubuntu 6.06) but it was all because of kubuntu being not
    the best kde-distro out there. \r\nEven though I have been using gnome instead
    of kde I allways was a kde-usere in heart so I knew sooner or later I would come
    back.\r\n\r\nI made 4.0 to magic release that I wanted to use KDE again. But as
    you said it was pretty much unusable. It was even hard to see the potential of
    the desktop. 4.1 was actually usable but not ok for the day to day work. But after
    all with 4.1 I changed all the KDE apps that I have been using in gnome (kmail,
    akregator, amarok and some others) to the 4.x versions.\r\n\r\nWith 4.2.2 I'm
    back in KDE. Not that I like everything about the desktop and there is still some
    work to do. But after all 4.2.x seams to be the release I use KDE again on a regular
    bases.\r\n\r\nSo after all I can also encourage everyone to take a look at the
    latest release (or wait till 4.3). It might fit your needs. \r\n\r\nThanks to
    all the developers."

  content: A lot of people don't understand that Kubuntu is a testing distribution
    because Ubuntu advertises itself as "Linux for human beings", easily installable,
    easy to configure, easy to use, without glitches, ... , and Kubuntu is officially
    part of the Ubuntu family, so people expect that the same philosophy applies to
    Kubuntu.  Clearly it doesn't and Kubuntu doesn't say on its website that people
    should not expect that it does.  That's why we (its unfortunate users, fooled
    by the not-kept promise of "Linux for human beings") are so angry at Kubuntu.

    ready (blame the distros, EVERYONE knew it wasnt ready for every day use. there
    was a warning on the bottle but no one ever reads these) so you switched desktops
    instead...\r\n\r\nI have yet to find one person to explain why you didnt jkust
    use KDE3.5  which was updated twice in 2008 and is still a great DE.\r\n\r\nDid
    s0omeone force you to use KDE4... no. you had to have the latest and greatest
    even though it wasnt ready.\r\nYou have TWO choices.\r\n\r\nTHE newest version
    of the greatest user frendly distro PCLINUXOS (im a Gento0o guy but for friends
    and family, PCLOS is low maintenance and just works out of the box) was just released
    last month and guess what.... its using KDE3.5.\r\n\r\nI like 4.2 but there are
    still a few things Id like to see back in 4.3 so Ill wait till June. You know
    why....because I can.\r\nAnd you know what Im going to do if its not ready for
    me in June.... wait till Xmas for 4.4.\r\nWhile my propretary using friends sit
    with old OS and desktops, I have one which is still kicking ass.\r\nWhy would
    I try an unfinished DE and then drop my current one for another one....makes no
    sense.\r\n\r\nI use KDE, XCFE, E17, XP and OS10 during a day of work.... I minimize
    all taskbars and use kids photos as background, so I could care less about the
    decorations. the only one I wont use out of principle is Gnome which is using
    the disease known as mono as integral parts of preograms like Evolution. i didnt
    mind it when it was plugins for Silverlite but not when its part of the core infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBtw,
    my brother is a distro whore and he keeps telling me that Kubuntu is never in
    his top 3 KDE distros. They break to many things to do it their own way and is
    a mess. He still recommends Mandriva as the best KDE4 distro.\r\nOf course, I
    think most people like him are just like the wine swishers and pot connaisseurs
    talking about bouquet and aroma.\r\nDistros using the same DE look the same.\r\nMy
    brother had 3 distreos running KDE4 on his machines and our brother in law asked
    if these werent the same.\r\nthey are."

  content: ! "@Tommy.S I moved from mandrake/mandriva (I think the last release I
    used was 2007? or 2006? the one after they started using years for versions) because
    I had enough of lagging so far behind and a lot of bs floating around at the time.
    As I recall at the time the latest Mandriva release had KDE 3.4.2 and people were
    using custom repos for 3.5 and when Mandriva came to 3.5 you still needed custom
    repos to get your hands on anything nearly remotely the latest version (I think
    3.5.3/4 was out while official repos were still 3.4.2 or 3.5.0 or something, I
    even recall them making a repo with 3.5.0 in it themselves at one point after
    enough people started bitching). Then to top it off the mandriva devs were slagging
    off the custom repos for \"ruining their distro\" when mandriva were clearly not
    meeting their targets users needs so, I got annoyed by the bs and moved to kubuntu
    since I heard good things (which for a while was the case, being English I have
    never had the translation issues so I count myself lucky in that respect). That
    being said I found Mandrivas forums to be very helpful, I usually struggle to
    get any kind of support on kubuntu forums or irc but I always had someone respond
    on Mandriva forums, I found that impressive. Have things improved?\r\n\r\n@KDE+Debian
    (if that is even your real alias :-P)\r\nIt's funny you say that it's meant to
    be testing when I clearly said that I got more stability out of a custom build
    of software that isn't even considered released yet, that sounds far more likely
    to fall over than kubuntu's should yet it didn't ... there were bugs with some
    behaviour since its still in development but it didn't crash or run slow like
    I have had with their packages (although so far I have to say jaunty has shaped
    up very well in comparison so I am quite pleased) ... interesting ...\r\n\r\n@lefty.crupps
    this proves one thing ... I suck as googling (I hate that word, we need a replacement
    ... searching sounds boring ...). However I am really not surprised. Fortunately
    it is not a feature I need, just me messing about for the most part, but doesn't
    excuse kubuntu :-)."

<p>When Kubuntu switched to KDE4 as it's main desktop, I was disheartened. KDE 4, at the time was just, well, pretty unusable for me. It kept crashing, I couldn't do the things that I wanted to, and I spent more time fighting with KDE than I did actually doing work. After about a week, I'd had enough, and I switched to Gnome.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people are probably going to respond to this with Gnome vs KDE flames, but let me explain my viewpoint on the whole "Desktop Environment" war</p>
<p>I prefer KDE, but if a desktop will let me do the work I need to do without getting in my way and causing issues, then I can learn to use it.</p>
<p>The above is possibly the reason that I can get along ok with Windows XP, but if I have to use Vista, I'll end up wanting to throw the machine out of the window.</p>
<p>So, for possibly the last year or so (I'm not too sure on the timescale!) I've been using Gnome in Ubuntu, and I must say, I've liked it. the fact that I can login, and instantly get access to my servers without having to type in my SSH key password (yes, insecure I know!), and that everything seems to integrate in a nice way, well.. it's been fun.</p>
<p>But still, my heart lies with KDE, and I've been flipping back to it to see how KDE4 is coming along on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So far, I've seen it gradually improving, and well, it looks damned sexy to be honest, but there were a few things that I felt it was missing. The ability to have multiple rows of apps on the task switcher was a big one for me. I generally have a lot of windows open, and I don't like the "Grouping" functionality. So when I get more than a few apps open, I could only see the icons. That's been fixed in KDE4.2, and it does it in a nicer way than Gnome does it (only switching to two rows once there are a certain amount of windows open.</p>
<p>Next on the list is the whole password management thing. Gnome does a GREAT job at this. I login, and it unlocks the default keyring, sets up the SSH agent, adds my key, unlocking it from the keyring, and I don't have to do anything but login with my normal user and password (though I intend to switch that to biometric login once I can be bothered to setup the fingerprint reader).</p>
<p>I've fixed that little issue (well, for SSH) by setting up an autostart script using ksshaskpass to add my SSH key when I login.</p>
<p>So far, KDE seems pretty usable for me now, but then, I'm quite happy to plod along on my Laptop and try things out. I'm feeling a bit lost with all the new functionality, and wishing that the Ubuntu Gnome Notifications (from pidgin, which I use as my IM client) didn't look so ugly in the new sexy KDE Desktop (in fact, if anyone knows a way to get pidgin to use the Jaunty style notifications in KDE, let me know, as they'd fit in quite well under the new KDE look :D) - I'd like to see some sort of common ground for notifications across the desktops, but who knows when that's going to happen!</p>
<p>I'll also try using it at work, if I can use it there without it getting in the way, then I will happily switch back permanently, but that's the ultimate test.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that KDE 4 will be usable for me soon, and I'll let you know if that's now</p>
