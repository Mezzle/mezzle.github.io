  content: Can they just serve a warrant for anyone who happens to be in an establishment?  That
    seems like violation of privacy because they don't have a warrant with your name
    on it.  I would have stood my ground.

<p>A phrase I've only ever heard once before today, which was when Igot frustrated at a camper in UT2004 :D</p>
<p> Anyways, in the process of moving home, and some other stuff going on, I no longer have access to the net from home anymore. So I decided this morning I'd go to an Internet Cafe up the road from me. Well - it was closed - apparently it doesn't open till 11am (which sucks) - so I went to the one about 3 doors away from that.</p>
<p> Well anyway, after about 5 mins (logging into gmail - and a site which I'm ashamed to admit I've gotten addicted to lately -MySpace) in walk the police, and ask to see the owner. Then ask me to back away from the computer. I'm wondering what the **** is going on.</p>
<p> Apparently, they had a warrant to search the computers for child pornography, and after checking my background, to make sure i wasn't a wanted criminal, they let me go.</p>
<p>Interesting though - I'm going to see if I can make some money out of it by setting them up a dansguardian proxy or similar ;)</p>
