<p>Steve Irwin, the famous crocodile hunter died this morning, aged 44, off the north coast of Australia. He was stung in the left side of his chest by a Sting Ray. His wife, terry, was hiking through the southern mountains of Australia at the time, and police had to be dispatched by helicopter to inform her of her loss.<br />
Having actually met steve, i feel this is a huge loss to the world. He will be missed, but hopefully his team at Australia Zoo will carry on his work, and his legacy</p>
