  content: ! "Hydrogen will fit Mez's description of a soundboard, other drum machines
    and sample players may work for this but I've found hydrogen has a reasonably
    intuitive interface.\r\n\r\n'Drums' visible in the mixer are mapped to both midi
    notes and keys on your alphanumeric keyboard, and placing the sound samples you
    wish to trigger as custom 'drums' should achieve the required results. \r\n\r\nI
    suspect the term 'soundboard' is somewhat overloaded as it also means mixing console
    to a lot of people."

<p>Does anyone know of one?</p>
