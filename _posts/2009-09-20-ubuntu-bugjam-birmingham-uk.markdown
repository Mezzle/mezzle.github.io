<p>The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam">Ubuntu Global Bug Jam</a> is just around the corner, and once again, the kind folks at the<a href="http://linuxemporium.co.uk/"> Linux Emporium</a> have kindly offered the use of their offices to the <a href="http://www.ubuntu-uk.org">Ubuntu UK</a> team.</p>
<p>Last time, we focused on bugs, and this time it's only slightly different.  Instead of it being a "Bug Jam" - it's just going to be a "Jam".  There will be people on hand to talk to about Bug Triaging, packaging, translating (and I hope we'll get the whole of Ubuntu <a href="https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+lang/en_GB">translated into English</a> by the end of the Jam), and anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>So, if you're interested in helping make Ubuntu a better distro, and live in (or can travel to) the Birmingham Area in the UK, then you're welcome to come along.</p>
<p>The Jam is on the 2nd-4th October, and we'll be around on all three days.  If you need more info, please feel free to email me on &lt;mez AT ubuntu DOT com&gt;.  Last year we had a great time, with refreshments (including beer) provided. <a href="http://mooney.wibbleh.com/images/ubj_penguinjuggling_resized.JPG">Juggling penguins</a>, and one person sleeping underneath the conference room table overnight.  Hopefully we'll also have the <a href="http://blog.glock.co.za/global-bug-jam-2009-south-africa">live Video Streams</a> up and running again for anyone who can't make it (or other Ubuntu Jams) to join in with!</p>
