  content: I've been using Pandora for a while, but it plays the same songs a bit
    too often if you use it for a long time. I have the feeling that Last.fm proposes
    a larger selection...

  content: There's also Soundflavor DJ which does what Pandora does but from your
    own music collection.  Makes playlists, recommends new music, and also recommends
    local area concerts.  Works really well.

  content: That you allow it to become seem simple together with your business presentation
    but I to discover this subject matter to be definitely something which I do think
    We would by no means fully grasp. It sort of feels as well elaborate and also
    substantial to me. We're impatient with your next article, I'll aim to find the
    cling of it!

<p>I just discovered a neat little app called "Pandora"</p>
<p>This app loads in a web browser and asks you for an artist name or a song title - and then goes and finds different music for you through the "Music Genome Project"</p>
<p>It's a very cool app - and free to use ;) It's already introduced me to 2 bands who I want to go out and buy the albums of ;)</p>
