    I think my version is the prettiest:

    apt-cache search ''^.*[^-]utils$'' | wc -l'

    How about this one:


    apt-cache search ''[^-]utils$'' | wc -l

  content: ! 'I was going to point out that apt-cache takes regexps, but instead I''ll
    just mention the --names-only option, which you want in this case (it still searches
    provides as well as the package name itself, which is why util-linux shows up,
    as it Provides: schedutils).'

  content: Sebastian, as that was the quickest thing to start with - before the expression
    was refined... yeah, stupid I know.. but, in my experience egrep is generally
    ungreedy

  content: Not only apt supports regular expressions directly, but also aptitude has
    much nicer support for searches. I never ever had to grep the output from aptitude,
    specially because it's impossible inside the (optional) GUI mode (and that's the
    main reason for aptitude having such a powerful search method).

<p>So, after the <a href="http://www.sourceguru.net/archives/105">last blog post</a>, I was talking to <a href="http://blogs.ubuntu-nl.org/dennis/">Seveas</a> and mentioned how I thought with all the nifty and useful commands coming in on here, I might make a <em>niftyutils</em> package. The conversation is as follows</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Mez&gt;    thinking of compiling a few of these into a nifty-utils package ;)<br />
&lt;Seveas&gt;    so we have coreutils, moreutils and nifty-utils?<br />
&lt;Seveas&gt;    just contribute them to moreutils :)<br />
&lt;Mez&gt;    and a few more<br />
&lt;Mez&gt;    patch-utils being the most obvious<br />
&lt;Mez&gt;    findutils, psutils ...<br />
&lt;Seveas&gt;    dennis@mirage:~$ apt-cache -n search utils | wc -l<br />
&lt;Seveas&gt;    266</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, so I had to get one up on this, as I only wanted fooutils, not foo-utils or foo-utils-bar, and came up with</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>apt-cache search utils | awk '{print $1}' | egrep '^.*[^-]utils$' | wc -l</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>for which I got told off. Awk can do everything, so why pipe to grep?</p>
<p>After a bit of back and forthing, the equivalent command, without egrep is</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>apt-cache search utils | awk '/^[[:alnum:]]*([-[:alnum:]])*[^-]utils[[:space:]].*/' | wc -l</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the first version was prettier.</p>
<p>Oh, and another comment relating to my last post, specially going out for "Bork Fomb":- I've deleted your post, and I'm glad I have approval on here - you could have done some damage to people who didn't know what that does, so here's a special command, just for you</p>
<blockquote><pre>sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 77.185.71.113 -j DROP</pre>
</blockquote>
