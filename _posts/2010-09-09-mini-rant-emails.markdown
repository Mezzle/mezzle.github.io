  content: ! "Empty subject's annoy me as well.\r\n\r\nMy pet peeve is signature's
    with images. I can generally can put up with HTML formatted E-Mails. But boy if
    you attach an image, I kill that little sucker ASAP."

  content: I agree. Plus it takes intelligence, i.e. brains, to  succinctly describe
    the body of the email in the subject line.

  content: ! "* Don't hit \"reply all\" just to say \"thanks\".\r\n* Don't send me
    unencrypted credit card numbers.\r\n* Don't send me an attachment when a link
    will do.\r\n* Don't expect me to drop everything I'm doing just to answer your
    stupid email within three minutes.\r\n* Don't put \"URGENT\" or \"Help!\" in your
    subject line unless you really, really, mean it."

  content: ! "I tend to use subject lines as tags.\r\n\r\nSo I just put in a few words
    that are relevent for searches. Interestingly, all technical people I know immediately
    understand why I did that, and some start doing it as well.\r\n\r\nI tend to see
    a better reply rate, esspecially for commercial emails, where somebody wants to
    reply to an old mail, or is reminded of an old mail, just because it shows up
    in a relevant search.\r\n\r\nOff course some mail clients do full-text searching,
    a lot of them don't."

<p>Please, those of you who send me emails, remember the following:-</p>
<ul>
<li>An email has a subject line - use it</li>
<li>If you put a proper description in your subject line, it's easier for me to find the email again</li>
<li>The subject line is that - what the email is about.  It's <strong>NOT</strong> meant for the entire content of your message, no matter how brief</li>
<li>If you send me an email entitled "FYI" - Don't bitch at me when I don't reply.</li>
<li>If you ask a question, and it's a vague one, don't get annoyed at me when I ask for clarification</li>
</ul>
