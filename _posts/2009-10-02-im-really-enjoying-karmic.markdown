  content: I tried the Beta today but it refuses to connect my intel 5100 wireless
    card to my TKip WPA network. I also didn't see xsplash but I guess you have to
    install for that. Also didn't manage to shut down  as it froze on a blank screen
    so not best impressed at the moment although I did take a look at the new Amarok
    and that looked nice - hopefully it can manage my Nano, nightrose says that it
    can but I've never seen it work.

  content: On the other hand Ubuntu is working perfectly, wireless just connects,
    xsplash works on the live cd and no freezes. Just a pity its gnome otherwise it
    would be great.

<p>Today, I reinstalled my laptop to use a fresh install of Karmic.</p>
<p>My laptop's one of those annoying ones that have problems, however, it seems Karmic has fixed a fair chunk of those. My wireless now works (though still only with WPA networks for some reason), I no longer have to boot with "nolapic_timer" (urgh!) and those annoying little niggles have gone. Also, Karmic is looking pretty swish. It's new notification icons are stylish and minimal, and the xsplash looks good.  Also, I've noticed that shut down time is drastically reduced! (2 seconds vs my old 10-15 seconds).<br />
Boot time isn't amazing, but it's pretty nippy.</p>
<p>I'm lovin it.</p>
