  content: Sure, but if he used linux, he could easily turn the software off. Linux
    gives you control, Windows lets you control everything someone else doesn't care
    about. sort off.

  content: ! "What I don't understand is that someone who was clearly incompetent
    decided to buy monitoring software that runs on the (supposed to be) monitored
    operating system.  It doesn't matter whether it's running on Windows or Linux,
    this means that if you really want, you can easily circumvent.\r\n\r\nThey should
    use a sealed(!) hardware device for this..."

<p>I just found <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/movie_pirate_linux_ban/">this</a> on the register.</p>
<p>While I agree that the punishment is fair, it just shows how nowadays it seems too many people are unaware of the impact of Free Software in today's community.</p>
<p>To be fair, I'd rather be offline than be forced to buy/use windows on a permanent basis. Espescially seeing as having to get used to a whole new system would be hell for me.</p>
<p>Though, he could always wait for KDE4 to be Windows Compatible and fully released and run that ;)</p>
