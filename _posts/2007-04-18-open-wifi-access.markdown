  content: ! 'I would like the idea of leaving my wireless open to others - but at
    the same time, the law does appears to state that YOU are resonible for any criminal
    activity that happens via your internet access - which rather puts me off.


    Still it''s good to know that there is at least one chap out there that take the
    time to inform you of an open wireless access point and how to fix etc - jolly
    good of him.


    The law in this case is an ass - many factory default installs of Windows XP will
    automatically join any open wireless point - without prompting you at all.'

  content: ! 'The problem with having an open AP is :


    1) Potentially anyone gains access to your network, inside the firewall (i.e.
    NFS issues etc)


    2) It''s possible that the police could come knocking with charges of child pornography
    etc being linked to your computer. Obviously you have an excuse, but it would
    seem to be a huge hassle for no gain.


    3) Bandwidth leeches - degrading your ADSL.


    Having said that, I did have an Open AP for some time, although it was on it''s
    own separate restricted network (i.e. ssh to server and http_proxy with username/password
    only).


    Having an open access point therefore becomes a good get-out-of-jail card if you
    do download anything illegal of course.... so it''s a two sided thing.


    When I have used open access points (e.g. in London), all traffic goes via SSH...

  content: There's a lot of over hyping of the risks of opening your wifi. OK, you
    do risk people hogging your download cap, but if, like me, you're not capped I
    don't see that as an issue.

  content: Surely, if you're wireless is unencrypted, anybody who is in range to connect
    can also intercept your data packets? They could then potentially be reading any
    personal information that is sent over the wireless as plaintext (such as emails).
    Obviously this depends on the network type (hub/switched), but even so this seems
    like a serious security hole.

  content: ! "Baz: It's not so much the download capping that would be an issue. It's
    like others have said, the illegal activity is what can be a hassle.\nDownloading
    child porn, movies, apps.\n\nIn response to blaming the people leaving their router
    open, I disagree on that point. The fact most people don't have a clue how to
    put a \"lock\" on their router doesn't mean you are free to use it.\nI have a
    pool and swingset in my backyard, would you think about walking by and jumping
    in my pool or have your kids use my swingset? I guess not and I believe the same
    should be applied to wireless access. \n\nYes people should know how to put a
    secure the wireless access, and manufactures should make it more clear how and
    why to do it. But an open access doesn't mean you are free to use it."

    a friend comes round or for chatting through Jabber on my laptop while sitting
    in bed. Everything important goes through my main PC, and If I need anything important,

    I don''t particularly need wireless, but it''s there, because my router I inherited
    has it, so why not let other people benefit ?'

  content: ! 'Mezz: Good point. A different example, you are on the beach, public
    space. You rent a chair, put your towel on it, put some of your bags underneath,
    it''s clear to anybody this chair is not theirs. Would it be OK for a stranger
    to use your chair while you are swimming in the ocean?


    My point is that if you are using somebody''s bandwidth you know it''s not yours
    so what gives you the right to use it? I think it is a bit harsh to have people
    arrested for using your bandwidth but I don''t believe it''s my responsibility
    to make sure nobody can use my bandwidth.


    In an apartment complex I can see how you sometimes use your neighbors wireless
    instead of your own and that''s accidental but to sit in front of a house, in
    your car and using a wireless you discovered that''s just to much.'

    A Chair is obviously only possible to be used by one person at a time, therefore,
    by them using the chair they''re denying you access to it. This would be a DoS
    attack in modern day times.


    Think of Wireless more of a very long bench. Would you begrudge someone sharing
    it if there was still space on it for you ?'

    If you rented the entire bench, you rented it for a reason, either you wanted

    on the bench without asking.'

    I''d be interested to know if anyone has ever been ''talked to'' by the police
    for what people have done on their open node.


    My policy is: so long as it''s not abused I keep it open.'

<p>Recently, <a href="http://walkertopia.com/blog.php/?p=190">Baz blogged</a> about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/6565079.stm">2 people being arrested for using other people's wifi for free access.</a></p>
<p>I actually read this in the Metro on the bus on the way home today, and I think it's ludicrous. OK, some people don't like it, but then most if not all Wireless Devices have the ability to use something  along the lines of WEP/WPA etc. Surely, you can either blame the people setting up the wireless router for not setting it up in a secure way, or blame the manufacturers for not getting across the point of how WEP/WPA are good, and should be enabled? I can find a basic description in my routers manual, which doesn't explain what these technologies are, just where to type in a key in the routers configuration screen.</p>
<p>I purposely leave my wireless open to the public (allbeit with traffic shaping so that my bandwidth doesn't get molested!) And so far, have had 7 "visitors" with one actually taking the time out to research who I was and email me telling me I had an open access point, and how to fix it. How kind of them, but I replied and explained to them what I was doing.</p>
<p>I urge anyone out there to have a look at <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">Fon</a> - free wireless for those who share theirs :D Enjoy!</p>
