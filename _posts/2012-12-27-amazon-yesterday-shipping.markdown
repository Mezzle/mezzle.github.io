<p>So, it seems that I've managed to have something delivered 2 weeks before it was ordered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourceguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screenshot-from-2012-12-27-220525.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-389" title="Screenshot from 2012-12-27 22:05:25" src="https://www.sourceguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screenshot-from-2012-12-27-220525-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>I had a chat with the Amazon agent - transcribe follows</p>
<blockquote><p>You are now connected to Aiyswarya from Amazon.co.uk.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Tracking info says that package was delivered 2 weeks before I ordered it.<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya: </strong>Thank you for contacting Amazon.co.uk. My name is Aiyswarya. May I know your name, please?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> my name is Martin (as should be given on account)<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya: </strong>Hello, Martin.<br />
Due to an error the tracking information of the City Link is given as delivered.<br />
In this case, I will contact City Link to deliver your parcel as soon as possible.<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>tracking information is given the wrong tracking number. Therefore I cannot track the package.<br />
Can you please have the information updated with the correct tracking information<br />
or provide the correct tracking information to me.<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya:</strong> I've checked the tracking information of your order and it states that your parcel is still in transit.<br />
In this case, I will contact City Link to deliver your parcel as soon as possible.<br />
As soon as we hear back from them we will update you via email.<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>To check the tracking, you must have the tracking id?<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya:</strong> Your tracking ID is <em>&lt;redacted&gt;</em><br />
<strong>Me: </strong>using that tracking information - that syas the parcel was delivered on the 12th December. to London<br />
that was 2 weeks before I placed the order.<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya:</strong> 27/12/12 18:38 Details of the consignment have been received from the consignor, but the collection Depot has yet to scan any goods.<br />
12/12/12 16:59 These goods have been successfully delivered.<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>So, my package has travelled in time?<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya: </strong>Yes<br />
You will receive your parcel on the estimated delivery date.<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> but it says It was delivered on the 12th - I didn't receive it.<br />
You've just confirmed that it's a time travelling package :)<br />
Amazon Yesterday shipping :)<br />
<strong>Aiyswarya: </strong>Yes you are correct.<br />
I understand your concern that the tracking states it was delivered on December 12, 2012.<br />
Due to an error the City Link information was incorrect.<br />
Now the issue has been resolved.<br />
The current tracking information states that your parcel is still in transit.<br />
I hope that you will receive your order on estimated delivery date, that is December 28, 2012.<br />
Is there anything else I can help you with?</p></blockquote>
