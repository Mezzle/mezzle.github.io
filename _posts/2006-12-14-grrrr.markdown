<p>Trying to update my control panel software (Manages stuff like email websites etc, etc) and I get this</p>
<blockquote><p>checking whether the C++ compiler (gcc   ) works... no<br />
configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C++ compiler cannot create executables.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kind of annoying, yes.</p>
<p> But even more annoying that it then went on to delete my current (working) copy of My control panel.</p>
<p>Luckily everything works, I just have to do things manually until I can get this fixed</p>
