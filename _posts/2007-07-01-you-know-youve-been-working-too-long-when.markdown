<p><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/katapult/+bug/72405">You ask for more info on a bug that you reported in the first place</a></p>
<p>I'm very tired, and I really can't remember reporting that bug, AND I can't reproduce it.</p>
<p>In other news, Katapult 0.3.2.1 has been released after months  of headaches trying to work out why it wouldn't build in a pbuild. Maybe if I hadn't been making it use one file from debian's libtool, and one from KDE's ... It's been a day for headaches is all I can say, I had to make two releases, as after I made the first, I only THEN found out that google had changed their URL syntax, rendering one of the new plugins useless.</p>
<p>I think I need a beer now.</p>
<p>And I must say, I was rather surprised that Gentoo got there first for including the new version of Katapult. Kudos to them for it, Debian came a close second... now just to wait to put in a sync request to Ubuntu.</p>
