  content: Maybe some sort of mild wireless interference occurs at 5pm every day,
    like central heating turning on, or someone parking their car nearby as they return
    from work. The tracking on your desk might be easier for it to work out than that
    of the mousemat.

  content: Well, it's a wireless mouse, so I guess the low battery level after working
    a couple of hours is the reason.

  content: Here's another possibility; If the mousemat is mildly shiny, and there's
    sun shining on it at that time of day, it COULD be reflecting back up into the
    mouse brightly enough to overwhelm the reflected laser light.   The desk, being
    a different surface, might not reflect the same way.

  content: ! "It's earth radiation. Seriously. Wireless mouses (mice are little rodents)
    are very sensitive to it. Usually, earth radiation is generated by crossing underground
    streams but I think it could be man-made in this particular case. 5pm means lots
    of people come home. First thing they do is have a good piss and flush their toilets.
    If there are crossing sewage pipes under your place, you get beams of earth radiation
    that will cease after a short while.\r\n\r\nWhat about the mousepad? Well, depends
    what it is made of. It probably acts like a lens concentrating the radiation on
    your mouse.\r\n\r\nUwe\r\n(staring blankly into infinity)"

<p>Could someone please tell me why, around 5pm every day for the last couple of weeks, my wireless laser mouse stops working when it's on the mousemat, but if I take the mousemat away, and use the mouse directly on the desk, it works fine...</p>
<p>I could understand if it just decided it didn't want to work on the mousemat, or didn't want to work at certain times, but specifically at a time, and specificaly on the mousemat. It's confusing, and REALLY annoying.</p>
