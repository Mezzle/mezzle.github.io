    simply because if we actually try and compile the code that's there now, it breaks
    things - porting to mono would be a HUGE pain!"

  content: Martin, wow! Thanks a lot for this one. I'm always running my desktop and
    laptop at the same time, especially when I'm working on the UWN. I've always cursed
    about having to change over to the laptops mouse and keyboard. With quicksynergy
    it is effortless. No more back pain from leaning forward to get at them, and so
    easy to set up. Can't thank you enough.

    and then run them over the network via seamlessRDP. Its a great little tool that
    allows you to run network apps like they were just another installed app on your

<p>Ok, so at work, pretty much the whole company uses Windows, of some sort. The web team, however, are pretty adamant that they use the best tools available for them, and we use Ubuntu because of this (because it's the easiest option that we all have the same distro, and as long as it's Linux, we don't mind)</p>
<p>Anyway, at the moment we're working through the process of moving all our internal business applications from Visual Basic.NET (urgh!) to PHP + a web based app. The "Product Owner" for this is one of the bosses, who currently uses Windows Vista.</p>
<p>He has, however, seen us all using Ubuntu and it's got him interested in using it. He's said that he wants to try using Ubuntu, and see whether he can get his work done on that, and slowly transition to it, as obviously, he needs to be able to use Windows for the .NET stuff (which sadly, doesn't work well under WINE).</p>
<p>So, we set him up a Virtual Machine, and he got to grips with what he was doing, great. Except for the fact that he had to allocate memory to it, switching back and forth between windows and Ubuntu was a pain. He eventually gave up on this idea, and got a spare machine, a spare monitor, and set it up next to his machine.</p>
<p>Still, however, it was a bit of a pain, he'd have to switch position on his desk, start using a different keyboard and mouse, and i was all a bit of hassle.</p>
<p>Recently, we've gotten a "big screen" (which isn't actually that big!) for the Web Team to monitor the servers, our order download service, etc etc. We were showing our manager some of the stuff we could do with it, and he asked the question "So, how do you control it" - to which my response was to move my mouse off of the edge of my screen, and onto the big screen. "So is that a third monitor?" he asked. "No" I replied, it's another machine.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a></p>
<p>So this is the point where I explained to our manager exactly what synergy is. Trying to explain it however, is a bit of a hassle, so I'll try my best here. Synergy is an application that allows you to control another machine's keyboard and mouse from your own PC. It's a bit of a mix between a KVM switch, and Remote Desktop, but it doesn't require extra hardware, and you dont have to relay the video across the network to show it on your screen too.</p>
<p>At this point, our boss got a glint in his eye</p>
<p>"Does it work in Windows?" he asked. At this point, I didn't realise that he had a seperate machine for Ubuntu. I told him it did anyway, but I wasn't too sure whether it worked with Vista</p>
<p>"Lets give it a go anyway"</p>
<p>So we went over to his machine, and I installed <em>quicksynergy</em> on his ubuntu box, while he downloaded the Windows installer for Synergy. 5 minutes later, he was grinning like a maniac as he moved his mouse from one machine to another.</p>
<p>Now he's happily using Ubuntu without any hassle, it's just a third screen to him - with different stuff on it.</p>
<p>I think the moral here is, there are different ways to get people to be able to use Linux, and Synergy is one of those great tools that enable people to use Linux without having all the hassle that comes with switching over.</p>
<p>I think also, a quote from m manager sums it up.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is one of the best things I've seen all year. I thought it'd take forever to setup, but it was so quick. I can be so much more productive now</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that this will be one of the turning points for my manager, and we'll have another convert by the end of the year</p>
