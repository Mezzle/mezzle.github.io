  content: I had a similar problem recently that was corrected by changing the output
    surface that Xine used. Apparently some change in my video card drivers made xv
    output stop working. Changing the Xine settings really just worked around a symptom
    of the problem, but since that seems to be the only thing that (for me) was negatively
    affected... I'd give you more details, but that was on a mahcine at home, and
    I'm at work right now...

    I have the compizfusion thing now and it seems that the "video" plugin is not
    working well... we''ll have to wait for a while to get fixed.'

  content: Had same issues - do you have an intel graphics chip?  Gutsy changed from
    the i810 driver to the intel driver. I had to change the output plugins for most
    of the players and then they worked fine.  If available in your media player,
    OpenGL output works nicely with this new driver.

  content: Use plain x11 output as a fallback. If you can do desktop effects, your
    video card will be fast enough to handle that.

    in apps when running compiz fusion does not work correctly because the xsever
    abi is different from the nvidia-driver's abi.\n\nIt has to do with a bugfix to
    make xserver work on ubuntu-mobile.\nBut it breaks with the current nvidia-driver.

<p>It seems that since I've started using gutsy, my PC does not want to play (well, display) any video files played through xine. Which is very very very very annoying. It worked fine originally in fesity, then, when I upgraded to gutsy, the video I wanted to watch decided not to play (and OGG/Theora video)</p>
<p>Then, due to issues, It still won't play. I've tried everything, adn xine itself isn't thtrowing up anything in the log that's making me think it's an issue with that.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas, or would anyone be able to tell me where to look to sort this out? I've been all over my xorg.conf, the Xine settings, all to no avail.</p>
<p>Any help would be muchly appreciated! This seems to be one of the only problems I'm, having with gutsy atm!)</p>
