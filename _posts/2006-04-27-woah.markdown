  content: You might want to try the Akismet plugin ( http://akismet.com/ ) - it's
    doing a wonderful job for my site - killing spam in a way that makes it seem completely
    effortless. After installing it, I only get REAL comments in my moderation queue
    :-)

  content: Have a look at Spam Karma. I've been using it since December 2005. I get
    around 150 spam comments per day. I've had maybe 5 false negatives and no false
    positives since I started using it. Anything it's not sure about, it leaves in
    your moderation queue, which is maybe 1 every few weeks.

  content: ! "Akismet is not truly free, since the \"secret sauce\" used by the Akismet
    service to evaluate your comments is not published anywhere.  Moreover, <em>all</em>
    of your comments go to Akismet, spam or not, for evaluation.  I have yet to see
    anything formal declaring Automattic's position on use of this data.  Personally,
    it gives me the willies, and I won't use it.\r\n\r\nSpam Karma 2 is quite popular,
    but I don't use it either.  It seems too \"heavy\" a solution.  It's technically
    non-free, too, according to the commercial use restrictions.\r\n\r\nI cobbled
    together <a href=\"http://www.skippy.net/blog/wp-content/plugins/sdm_spam_check.phps\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">my own</a> anti-spam plugin.  This, along with a reasonable set
    of blacklisted words, suffices for my blog.  I still get some junk, but it's a
    few pieces every couple of days, as opposed to dozens per day."

<p>106 Comments awaiting Moderation on my blog today.</p>
<p> Guess how many of them weren't spam.....</p>
<p> <strong>Two</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right. Two... It's nice to know that these bots are here trying to sell drugs, online poker, and porn sites through my blog.</p>
<p> It's amazing what people are like nowadays - it's just stupid. Spam should be in an easily filterable form and email only... or just non-existant.</p>
<p> Now to hack away a little to auto-delete these comments - unless anyone knows of a nice Wordpress plugin that'll do it for me ?</p>
