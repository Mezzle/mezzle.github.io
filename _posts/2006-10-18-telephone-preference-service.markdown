<p>I've just had to sign up to the <a href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/">Telephone Preference Service</a>, after, 1 hour after having my new phone line fitted at my new place, I recieved a marketing call, and then another from the same company an hour later.</p>
<p>The installation guy must have tipped them off it was ok to call :P</p>
<p>And now to sort out my problems with my ISP</p>
