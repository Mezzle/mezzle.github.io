<p>I know I'm a bit behind on the band wagon, but I've fallen in love with <a title="Technorati: uberness" href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati.</a> Basically, I was playing around with <a title="Opera Mini: more uberness" href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/campaign/">Opera Mini</a> on my Samsung D600... and found that it had a search feature for Technorati.</p>
<p>Now, knowing vaguely what Technorati is - I decided to snoop around a little, and find out what people had been blogging about <a title="Katapult: KDE Launcher App" href="http://www.thekatapult.org.uk/">Katapult</a>... just to be nosy.</p>
<p>Well - after reading through a few blog posts about Katapult, (and finding we have a lot of spanish fans) I started reading some links from blogs that were writing about katapult, and well - I was browsing round the blogosphere for a while... 3 hours in fact. OK, so this bought my mobile phone bill up a little (darn high GPRS charges), but well... It was great. I fell in love with technorati.</p>
<p>I've claimed my blog, and hope to be tagging my blog posts from now on.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 isn't all it's hyped up to be, but some tools, like technorati, are just worth looking at.</p>
