  content: I really wanted to try this, but what put me off is the thought of having
    bluetooth turned on all the time (wasting battery). I know this would really bother
    me, and I would instead constantly be turning the bluetooth on and off when needed,
    which then again would be more of a hassle than just typing the password...

  content: Hmm.. Sounds really cool, but on the other hand it must be handy sometimes..
    For example to create SSH tunnel, when I leave my house.. :) It will be very nice
    to have this functionality in KBluetooth (or KMobileTools)..

    like - 1 day off of the battery, (from ~7 days)\r\n\r\nNasaK - indeed it would,
    and that's a great idea for a use of it (though, my ipv6 tunnel works backwards
    too!)"

  content: ! "@Mez\r\nI would say that's quite a bit... But then again, all is relative.
    For me, using it maybe on average three times a day I wouldn't want to use 1/7
    of the battery for that.\r\nBut for someone in a work environment or a similar
    environment where it is very important to lock up and secure stuff; I would absolutely
    understand it."

  content: ! "Hi there,\r\n\r\njust to mention: you would not necessarily need a phone.
    If you like to you can use an old bt headset, it may even not work because the
    speaker or mic is dead. Anything small enough to carry in your pocket and bluetooth
    enabled can do. Although I figured using the phone is the most obvious tool because
    it is already there.\r\nI got the idea (btw. I wrote BlueProximity) while browsing
    thinkgeek where they had a proximity detector tool consisting of a special usb
    dongle and a carry-with-you token. It costed way too much and was for windows
    only. Since I always have little money and linux installed I had to do this with
    things I already have... Probably the MacGyver principle, except it is not designed
    to blow up. :-)\r\n\r\nBye\r\nLars"

<p>So, yesterday, my new Bluetooth adapter arrived. I've been wanting one for a while so that I can quite quickly push new files to my phone (for ringtones, etc)</p>
<p>However, while playing with bluetooth (and trying to setup a bluetooth headset - which is the biggest headache EVER!) - I stumbled across a package called blueproximity.</p>
<p>The application allows you to use a bluetooth device as a proximity sensor.</p>
<p>Basically, it uses the bluetooth protocol to "ping" the bluetooth device, and then run commands when the signal strength gets low (or hich)</p>
<p>At the moment, I have it setup to do a couple of things, firstly, I have it set to lock/unlock my session, and switch my monitor on/off if I leave the range/enter the range. I've set this up so that the unlock is on entering the room, but the "lock" is only if I leave the house.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have a habit of leaving for work, and forgetting to disconnect from my server's screen session (running irssi) - meaning that when I come back, the highlights don't show in irssi's away log. So, I've added another sensor that will close my screen session (ssh &lt;myserver&gt; screen -D) if I leave the house. Very useful!</p>
<p>While the app isn't perfect, and could do with some "built in" features (rather than having to specify commands). It's a great app with huge flexibility ;) I can think of many uses for it, espescially in an office environment (I remember my boss emailing me from my account once saying "I'm a security risk, I left my station unlocked" - blueproximity would have solved this issue!</p>
<p>If you're in an office, and have bluetooth enabled, this is a great security feature... I think the whole "walk up to the desk and your monitor switches on and unlocks itself" feature is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Though, it does leave a security risk if someone steals your bluetooth device (in my case, this is my phone!)</p>
<p>&lt;edit&gt;Knew I'd forgot something :-</p>
