  content: ! "Hi Martin,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for all of your compliments!
    \r\n\r\nAbout my tutorial, well, I could do in English, but it would take some
    time and I don't have so much time, maybe two or three days. If you want that
    i can do it and you can publish it in your site (I have one blog in English but
    it's in standby...).\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, I'm wondering how did you knew my launchpad
    username.. :D\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nClÃ¡udio Novais"

  content: ! "Launchpad? Well, it has a nice search function if you know where to
    go!\r\n\r\nNo worries about the english version - I just thought it'd be cool
    to see something similar in english. The well thought out stuff, etc etc."

  content: ! "I'd be willing to do it, but my site doesn't get much attention. Plus,
    I think the code you wrote has some errors, as it gave me trouble :(\r\n\r\nI'll
    give the one from the portuguese tutorial (can't understand it lol, but my spanish
    skills may help)."

<p>My <a href="https://www.sourceguru.net/archives/212">latest blog post</a> about PPA Keys has had a few comments already. Having just returned from visiting my parents, I've noticed an email asking me to approve a Pingback.</p>
<p>The pingback was to a <a href="http://ubuntued.info/">Portuguese site</a> which had taken my post and written it into a <a href="http://ubuntued.info/2009/06/mantenha-as-chaves-gpg-do-launchpad-sempre-actualizadas.html">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I've got to say, my portuguese may not be up to scratch, but it's obvious that this is a well written tutorial. I'm very impressed by this site, and the way that they've written, and illustrated this tutorial.</p>
<p>All I can say is, great site <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~claudiocn">Claudio</a>! Keep up the good work! Something like this site in English would be an asset to the ubuntu community. It's well thought out, and well written</p>
