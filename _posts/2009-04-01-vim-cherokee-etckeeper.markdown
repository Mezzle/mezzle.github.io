    way = hjkl instead of arrows, not moving around in insert mode.\r\nAnnoying and
    slow to start with, super-efficient when you get used to it."

    got around to the "bound branches" - was considering it just mailing diffs whenever
    it committed.

    is currently waiting in Debian's NEW queue as it includes some new binary packages

    was awaken from a long lethargy and is now moving at quite a fast pace.

<p>Ok, so, today, I started using vim. I've never really had the time before to learn how to use it. I think the most I'd learned before today was just how to get out of vim if I ever accidentally got into it.</p>
<p>Now, however, I'm quite happy to do basic editing of files with it. I've got to say, I'm impressed with it's code highlighting features. </p>
<p>I hope to eventually switch to vim permanently, but I'm not that confident with it yet - my first command was "nano ~/.vimrc" *chuckles*</p>
<p>Anyway, next comes cherokee. I'm actually loving this webserver. It's so simplistic, yet so powerful, and it's admin interface is a dream. If anyone out there is interested in having a lightweight server, have a look at cherokee before you go and install lighttpd !</p>
<p>The most exciting new thing that I've been using of late is etckeeper. (ok, maybe exciting isn't the word - but I like it!). This hooks into a RCS and basically keeps a track of your /etc/ folder. It will automagically commit changes made to it when using apt-get (or similar) and I've actually set mine up to have bound branches. Meaning that my /etc/ is kept on a remote server.</p>
<p>All my machines are now using etckeeper (with the exception of the eeePC, which is tucked away in a corner with a network lead plugged into the back, being used as a playground machine) and I'm happy that if I ever have a hard disk crash, I can always get my configuration back from my server in a simple manner (which is massively useful for stuff like X).</p>
<p>Anyway, just some stuff I've been playing with of late. It seems I'm switching more and more to the command line :D</p>
<p>Maybe I should start using w3m instead of Firefox?</p>
