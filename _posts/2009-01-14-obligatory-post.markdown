<p>Ok, so here's my obligatory "Hello Planet Debian" and "I'm now a Debian Developer" post.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I'm now a Debian Developer - and have a shiny new email address. For those of you considering going through the NM process, or already going through it - don't give up hope, you'll get there eventually!</p>

<p>In other news, I've been meaning to blog about a couple of sites for a while now.</p>

<p>The next site is <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - I've mentioned this briefly before, but it's a great site. A community driven Programming Q+A site. Kind of hard to describe, but go have a look, you'll soon get the gist of it!</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it's time to head to bed for me!</p>
