<p>Over the next few days, I'll be re-installing my main Desktop from scratch with Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex.</p>
<p>This is mainly to help me cleanup my PC (I've got a lot of stuff on it) and also so I can make better use of my system.</p>
<p>So, first of all I need a copy of Intrepid. I've opted for the alternate CD as I want to try LVM + Software RAID.</p>
<p>I've also decided already that I will be completely removing Windows from this machine (having previously had an archaic Windows 2000 install for playing online poker).</p>
<p>While I reinstall, I'm going to be using my trusty eeePC to blog about it, so hopefully those little snags that I hit along the way will be documented somewhere, and hey, it might even make for some good reading.</p>
<p>Well, as we all know, the first step to re-installing a system is... backup...</p>
<p>I'm currently sitting here waiting for my home directory to tar itself up onto my external 1TB hard drive, and watching as the file list goes past, I realise just how lax I've been at keeping my home directory tidy. I've got the last ~6 years of crap in there (including a backup of all my music which I'd thought I'd lost years ago! - yay!)</p>
<p>I'm backing up my home drive as I'm going to be wiping that, which, while it means re-installing all my settings, etc etc, means that I have a clean start (and if I actually do need something out of it, I can just pull it out of the tarball ;) )</p>
<p>Well, the backup's on it's way, my download of the ISO has 15 minutes left, so I'll go ahead and hit publish, with the final words.</p>
<p>See you on the flip side.</p>
