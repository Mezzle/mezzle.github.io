<p>As you may or may not know, I'm in the New Maintainer Process for Debian, well, not long back, (a few days) I finished off the Tasks and Skills #2, and today my Application Manager (Steffen Joeris aka white) filed my AM Report, reccomending me as a Debian Developer.</p>
<p>You can find a copy of my AM Report <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2008/10/msg00030.html">here</a></p>
<p>Thanks to all those who've helped me along the way, including (but not limited to) Steffen (white), Francois (fmarier), Nelson (naoliv), Sune (pusling), Ana, Adam (infinity) and many many others :</p>
