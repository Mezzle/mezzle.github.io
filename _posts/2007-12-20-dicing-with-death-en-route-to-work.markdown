    You should get a phone with a memory card slot. My RIZR is pretty much proprietary
    but it still works with linux. Also, It''s moddable!  (Although linux motorola
    phone modding is still way behind windows (the only functional took we have is
    moto4lin (which is dated, does not work with new phones) and a new command line
    tool...but the developer is developing a GUI for it). But still...it''s pretty
    much fun.'

<p>Today on the way to work, a truck crashed into the railway bridge as my train was going over it. Luckily, noone was injured, and it was right by the station I had to get off at anyway. Now at work, but have an interesting photo to add to my collection</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourceguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/crash.jpg"><img src="https://www.sourceguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/crash-thumb.jpg" alt="Truck into bridge thumbnail" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>(Click for full size image)</p>
<p>Sorry about the quality, it was taken on my Mobile Phone Camera... which I spent ages playing with someone else's Vista machine so I could get the picture off of it. Damned Proprietary Software. I should go get a greenphone</p>
