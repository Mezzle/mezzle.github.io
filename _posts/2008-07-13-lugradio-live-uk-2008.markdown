<p>Is less than a week away</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/480019347_3892087dce_m.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/230/480023477_8a690b9c72_m.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, yes, am on crew, and am also on the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/speakers">Speakers List</a> as I'm organising the <a href="http://forums.lugradio.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=4170">Keysigning Party</a>.</p>
<p>If you've got the weekend spare - and can make it to Wolverhampton - why not come along and meet some of the wonderful people that are the LugRadio community. It's only Â£5 on the door (which is entry for both days) and well - Just look at <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/schedule">the schedule</a> to see the kind of talks that are going on.</p>
<p>Plus, It's also going to be the <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1208">LAST EVER LugRadio</a> - so it's really your last chance to see, plus you'll be participating in a historic moment in FLOSS history (just wish it was the start of something rather than the end!)</p>
<p>So obligatory LRL advertising post over - hope to see you there!</p>
