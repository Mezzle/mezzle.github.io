  content: ! "Completely random, but the FF dictionary can be set on the right button
    menu under Languages. It's sticky, IIRC, and applies to all websites and forms
    from that point on; it's also settable from about:config (spellchecker.dictionary
    = en_GB). Wonder if this is sensitive to xml:lang or the HTML 'lang' attribute?\r\n\r\nI
    tend to make it spellcheck all form fields, not just textareas (layout.spellcheckDefault
    = 3). As a result, my spelling is getting progressively worse."

  content: ! 'Well, I use four dictionaries myself:

    - British English;

    - American English;

    - French (classical);

    - French (1990 reform).

    (And then I have South African English, and I really don''t know why.)


    I just right-click on textareas to change the reference dictionary.


    Â«Wonder if this is sensitive to xml:lang or the HTML â€˜langâ€™ attribute?Â»

    As of Firefox 2.0.x, no, it''s not.

    I thought there was an extension that took care of this, but I can''t seem to
    find it.'

  content: ! "I found the Firefox extension: â€œDictionary Switcherâ€\x9D\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/3414\n\nThere's
    a manual mode where you can click in the status bar to switch dictionaries (if
    you use only two or three dictionaries it might be quicker than the right-click
    thing), an automated mode where the dictionary is chosen based on the `lang` information,
    and then an experimental â€œDetect as I typeâ€\x9D mode."

  content: I had similar from a well-known supermarket in the UK, but when I checked
    they had not charged me any extra for the substitution.  I assume this was some
    sort of sweetener to say sorry for not having the thing you wanted!  Are you sure
    they charged you for the three replacements?

<p>Online food shopping - oh the joy.</p>
<p>When you shop for food online, generally, something will be out of stock, so you'll get it substituted for a similar item.  This I can accept.</p>
<p>However, my monthly shopping came last night, and there was one replacement.</p>
<p>This would have been fine, it was a pasta sauce that they simply substituted for another flavour. However, for some reason, they substituted 2 x Flavour I asked for for 3 x Other Flavour.</p>
<p>Considering that the products differ only on their content (the flavour) and are the same price and weight, what makes them think that adding an extra one to my order is correct?</p>
<p>*sighs* I accepted it anyways, as it was actually the flavour I wanted, but couldn't find on the website.</p>
<p>And on another note, darn Firefox for flagging up "flavour" as a spelling mistake. (even with the language set to en_GB!)</p>
