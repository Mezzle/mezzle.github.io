    hope this is acknowledged within the wider community as elitism should not be

    driving factor behind it's success."

  content: ! "Sad to see a dedicated and obviously passionate member go.\r\n\r\nI've
    tried to use the Ubuntu IRC for a while and found it darn near impossible to make
    any sort of connection with people at all - not for want of trying, being effusive
    or enthused... but just because i was an outsider i guess.\r\n\r\nThe IRC's fulfil
    an important role in the entire Ubuntu ecosphere, and it'll just that little bit
    harder to use now you're going."

  content: I am not about to say, "I am sorry to see you go." Everything you hit on
    is exactly the reason I left a while ago, and exactly the reason I brought up
    this whole IRC fiasco during UDS Mt. View.

  content: ! "Sorry to hear that. But it does not surprise me at all. After all the
    years what Ubuntu has existed, I have seen the whole Ubuntu community to grow
    as to be elite group.\r\nMaybe the reason is that Ubuntu gets greatest media attention
    and thats why it gets big share of new Linux OS users. Among those are users who
    are frustrated to Microsoft dominant market position and the whole software \"world\"
    over there.\r\nBut they have moved the same anger (and passion) to Linux side
    as well. It might be accident, but I do not believe it so. Ubuntu really lack
    the community for others. It is one big inner circle what really believes that
    they are the best and greatest. It just does not end to IRC Team. It just begins
    from there and continues all the way to whole Open Source community."

    connection to any of this; I saw your post through dot.kde.org and it amused me.)"

  content: Not really surprised at all. Unfortunatly the same behavior is not only
    on IRC but also in launchpad where I seldom report bugs anymore after multiply
    comments as "It's working here, you did a mistake", that can be true but when
    the bug is corrected upstream because I did myself the report I do think that
    the comments were just bullshit. Very strange things in ubuntu sphere. So I am
    studying different distributions because of this and for now the one which is
    going above all of them technically and how the people are acting is pardus.

  content: ! "A problem ignored...\r\n\r\nFor years the elitism you have mentioned
    is exactly the case. I've watched Ubuntu ops \"demand\" that a person answer them
    with words like \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME\". These folks are not parents of Ubuntu
    users, they're not even caring facilitators. Bullies is the word plain and simple.
    They've driven and will continue to drive people away. Bug #1? In a word it's
    not Microsft.\r\n\r\nI've been on mibbit IRC for a while and find them much more
    pleasant, so based on your post I created #Ubuntu there, for the Ubuntu Diaspora.
    Not a support channel perse, just a place for folks who use an OS that want to
    be able to talk like grown ups and be treated as autonomous individuals without
    being marginalized.\r\n\r\nAnd no, like another I'm not sorry to see you go. Men
    of integrity, whether they be waepmen, wombmen or wifmen should center themselves
    around other men of integrity. This is only one step in a long series for you
    and I am glad you have done it so publicly. Up until now the majority of the voices
    highlighting the problem have been those of the marginalized, so their voices
    have been dismissed.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of the real."

  content: ! "It is sad that things have become such that you had to leave.\r\n\r\nBut
    this is a cultural thing that will not end until Canonical makes a clear statement
    about it and acknowledges that the problem exist. And then follows up by actively
    chasing anyone that resort to tactics like this. It will be a lot of work for
    a while, but in the end, everyone will benefit from it. But it has to come from
    the top.\r\n\r\nAs with all kinds of bullying, it is a form of control technique,
    an attempt of controlling the environment they are in.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem
    that will burn a lot of people so they never return. Respect and kindness are
    words that seems to be out of fashion now..."

  content: IRC always ends up this way. It doesn't matter what the channel is about
    or who started it. Somehow being able to actual use an IRC client makes people
    think they're God or something.

<p>After long deliberation (a good few months!), I today came to the decision that I no longer felt that I could be part of the Ubuntu IRC Team.</p>
<p>I have felt for a long time that the Ubuntu IRC team has become an elitist crowd, with a very cliquey inner circle, and those who are not in the inner circle being treated on multiple levels like second class citizens.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that have pushed me to make this decision, and I've not made it lightly. I've voiced my concerns to the IRC Council previously, (via individual emails), and had no response.  I don't see the situation getting any better. In fact, more and more, I see it getting worse.</p>
<p>I know that I'm not the only person who's thinking this way, though I may be one of the only ones that feels that I need to lay down my cinnamon roll.  I've discussed these issues on multiple occassions with various members of the community (both in and out of the team), and with people linked to the Ubuntu IRC community in one way or another (Debian Developers, Freenode Staff, etc etc).</p>
<p>There are also other people who've come out of the woodwork after I posted <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-irc/2009-September/000627.html">my resignation</a>. Within minutes of doing so, one member forwarded my mail onto the community council, and another replied with <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-irc/2009-September/000629.html">his thoughts and feelings regarding the matter</a>.  I'm glad to see that there are other people out there who've seen what I've seen, and like me, also dislike it.</p>
<p>I will however, retain my @ in #ubuntu-uk.  This is a channel I participate regularly in, and the ops there are chosen by the LoCo Team, rather than the IRC council.</p>
