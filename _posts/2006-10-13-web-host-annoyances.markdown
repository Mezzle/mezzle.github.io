    it.  I'll be on to them in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe ads don't even make sense!
    \ Trips to St Petersburg when you access Pete Connolly's page?  Useless.  Thanks
    for the notification..."

  content: ! "\"I used to think that 1and1 were a reputable company.\"\r\n\r\nas did
    i, until they knocked our MySQL DB's offline intermittently for about a week,
    then Apache as well. explanations provided? zero. \r\n\r\nwe made the switch a
    while back, and i highly recommend that all 1and1 customers do the same. they've
    clearly grown too quickly, and are making poor decisions with respect to their
    business practices and support policies."

  content: Now the cheese link is generating even more money for them. Why don't you
    just create your own 404 page then?

  content: I have no problem with the actual hardware the uptime and the software
    on the root server is good, but the support is disgusting so i'll probably be
    moving too.  I've had a number of emails recommending http://www.dreamhost.com/
    - Dreamhost.  Might have to look into these guys.

  content: Um... 1and1 is one of the worst companies in existance, what with their
    DNS scams, server outages, and insanely overpriced shared hosting and what-not.  Use
    LayeredTech.

  content: ! "Thanks for the heads-up on that one.\r\n\r\n1&amp;1 and consistently
    offering the most bang for buck from what I can see so I can't see me moving soon
    but I have certainly started making custom error pages to avoid this uncontrolled
    advert. While I don't mind it too much the chance of advertising something I don't
    agree with or find immoral, etc. means I would rather not have it happening by
    default. \r\n\r\nI might have a look around at other hosts but it is a nightmare
    moving a load of domains and getting all the e-mail addresses set up again (especially
    when you have a lot of non-technical users)."

<p>It seems my web host has taken it upon itself to, instead of displaying generic ErrorDocuments, to display ErrorDocuments with Adverts in.</p>
<p>This - I am not happy with, and I'm sure is illegal for them to do (generating revenue from every customer's site who hasn't set a custom 404 page!)</p>
<p> To see what I mean - see <a href="http://dev.sourceguru.net/cheese" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p> I think this is totally wrong and unethical. I've been thinking of changing hosts for a while now anyway, and this is now just something that tops it. I will be moving.</p>
<p>I used to think that 1and1 were a reputable company. Now I do not, and I will be writing to them in the near future to express my disgust at this outrage.</p>
