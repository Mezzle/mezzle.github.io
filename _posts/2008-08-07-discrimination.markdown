  content: ! 'As far as I know it is legal (in the US anyway), but awfully weird.
    I can see not allowing smoking on the job, but not even employing a person if
    the smoke is really odd. The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission says you
    can''t discriminate based on: sex, race, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals
    with disabilities.'

  content: ! "It is most defineately NOT legal. That's one.\r\n\r\nSecond you could
    make it a \"religious\" issue. Aren't you native american ? Lots and lots of cultures
    (and religions) smoke, sigarettes may not be very much used, but pipes are present
    in just about any religion. Even in Christianity there are (ancient) rituals that
    involve smoking. Using this would be lying, obviously, but then again, most religious
    lawsuits are lies too, and they get lots of money sometimes.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    unless you really still think that \"human rights\" law is applied equally to
    all citizens, I wouldn't try it. After all this is discrimination in order to
    advance \"progressive\" ideals and the judge will be reluctant, to say the least,
    to stop that.\r\n\r\nOr you could restart your application ... and lie. There's
    no law against that."

  content: It would be really stupid if it was illegal. Imagine yourself running a
    company and you have a damn right to employ whoever you want! It's *your* company
    and you know best how to manage it. At the previous place I worked smokers usually
    took twice the breaks the non-smokers did, so such policy is quite understandable
    - but IMHO it's quite stupid in a company which relies heavily on education and
    skills of certain person .. in any case, life goes on. :)

  content: ! "I am not a lawyer, but I have taken quite a few classes on Business
    Management and Constitutional Law.  The answer to you question of \"Is this legal?\"
    is yes, and here is why:\n\n1) An employer may not discriminate based on gender,
    unless safety is a legitimate defensible explanation.\n2) An employer may not
    discriminate based on religious beliefs.\n3) An employer may not discriminate
    based on age, but this only actionable if you are over 50.\n4) The Americans with
    Disabilities Act forces employers to make reasonable accommodations (at their
    own expense) to employees with disabilities (if alcoholism is a disease, why isn't
    nicotine addiction), and they cannot discriminate, unless safety is a legitimate
    defensible explanation.  \n\nAre you getting the point?  There are a total of
    9 protected classes in the U.S., and smokers are not any of them, neither are
    white males or homosexuals.\n\nUntil I read your post, I thought that the worst
    thing to be in the U.S. was a terrorist, but apparently, it is a white homosexual
    male smoker.  My guess is that you would be happier work for a company that is
    not myopic, like that one."

  content: ! "Yes, I am. Personally, I think it's my own right and own freedom to
    smoke if I wish. I can understand their point of view, but I can also understand
    that I'm a considerate smoker.\r\n\r\nI also find, personally, that that 5/10
    minutes outside when I'm having a cigarette generally, when coding, allows me
    to re-focus my mind. I'm sure my previous employers will tell you that I've generally
    come in from a cigarette break asking questions, or proposing new ideas. It's
    for the same reason that I run rsibreak. Whether I was a smoker or not, I'd still
    have those breaks (to go make a cup of tea, or something similar) that allow my
    mind to calm down and re-focus. Generally I'll come back from a smoke break and
    be more productive than before I went on it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I find it gives me a
    chance to have a walk around, and stretch my legs, which, with my disability,
    is pretty important for me.\r\n\r\nI agree with all the other posts here, smoking
    is bad, but it's my choice to do so. I'm not forcing you to. I have to go outside...
    it's MY choice (and I'm planning to give up anyway!)"

  content: Ianal, but I hope it's legal. No one should have to deal with smokers.
    They are annoying and a health hazard to everyone around them. They are also inconsiderate
    (as a group, not specifically you). They light up when they want without regard
    to who is around them. They also seem to think it's okay to toss their trash wherever
    they want. I hope more and more people adopt positions that discriminate against
    smokers. I'd like to see it illegal.

  content: ! "As an aside.. I recently had to visit a specialist medical practitioner
    with my daughter. She had a condition which was exacerbated by cigarette smoke.
    Neither my wife nor I smoke, but other family members do. The Professor we saw
    said that even if family members smoke outside, when they come in they continue
    to breathe out very nasty particulates over the rest of the family. \r\n\r\nPassive
    smoking doesn't doesn't mean someone has to be sat next to you for you to be inhaling
    their exhaled nasties. It can happen for some time after too.\r\n\r\nPicture yourself
    as one of the co-workers, sat near a smoker. Is it fair on them that you come
    back from a cigarette break and breath that over them?\r\n\r\nIf I were employing
    people, after checking the legality, I too would not employ smokers. For the above
    stated reason and also because I think they vastly under-estimate the amount of
    time they spend away from their desk smoking."

  content: ! "I wonder if the reasoning behind this is that they are trying to minimize
    the cost of insuring employees. If insurance is the reason, it makes sense; smokers
    are high-risk, thus it costs more to share that risk. The employees may not care
    if you actually smoke (or if you don't) but maybe don't like what it does to their
    bottom line.\r\n\r\nNow, is this probably a policy that's offensive to most smokers.
    Especially since they didn't state their reasons behind it, it could easily be
    construed as prejudice against smokers. Your concern may very well be valid.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I have no idea what laws and practices are where you are from so I don't know
    if the place you are seeking employment even has an insurance industry (as opposed
    to government health plans, etc). I just figured I'd add a little perspective.
    Thanks, I enjoy reading your blog on Planet Ubuntu."

    would not like to be employed at a company where everybody are clones. How boring
    is that?? If you are cloned (Western version of Mao uniforms?) it is more than
    likely that \"life\" is utterly boring. \r\n\r\nEventually most clones will break
    out one way or another. (Smoking pot at weekends, cocaine, mountainclimbing, MTB,
    diving, swinging, collecting stamps).\r\n\r\nStreamlining humans is a bad thing.
    Humans are not perfect and they do not have perfect health. You can be healthy
    and kill your colleagues with pure boredom.\r\n\r\nThe banning of smokers as employees
    is just the same as excluding women, pregnant women, homosexuals, army veterans,
    non-white, garliceaters, curryeaters, disabled, old, young, whaterver.\r\n\r\nThe
    smokers are out - then overweight - then diabetes - then those with relatives
    died of cancer - then parents of disabled kids - then with healthy kids - then
    people with glasses.\r\n\r\nWhere do you draw the line? When does it become healthfacism?
    In my opinion the question is: Does whatever you do or whatever you are preventing

  content: ! "While I don't know about the legal aspects of it various countries,
    I'd find it somewhat disturbing they could refuse to employer purely on the grounds
    of being a smoker.\r\n\r\nHaving it a condition of employment (applicable to everyone)
    that you don't smoke at work, I'd be okay with - but refusing to employer a smoker,
    even if they are not going to smoke at work, sound dodgy to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's
    my responses to various reasons given above for not employing smokers:\r\n\r\nWastes
    a hour a day smoking - as well as the large number of places where you can't smoke
    at work, can I assume you won't want to employ anyone who wastes time at work?
    Like the people who have a cup of tea three or four times a day, or do stretches
    for a few minutes every hour (as the OH&amp;S rules at work technically say we're
    supposed to)\r\n\r\nSmells, agitating allergies, etc. - this is more reasonable,
    but there are quite a few other things that could do it too, and I doubt that
    they're stopping anyone in the workplace wearing perfume, wearing deoderant after
    they finish their jogging at lunch time, or accepting flowers from their partner
    on their anniversary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summary, while not letting you smoke at work
    might be okay, I can't see how refusing to employ you purely on the grounds of
    being a smoker could be any better than refusing to because you have red hair,
    have a New Zealand accent, or play gold on the weekends."

    may be non-smokers or people with breathing problems who might seriously get offended

    and in some jobs the whole job might be about interaction. In such scenarios,
    smoking might have a serious impact on work life. Also, the company might have
    had bad experiences with insurances, as smokers are more prone to cardio problems
    and hence the chance of paying insurance for such employees are more. May be the
    company considers that smoking is one of the main causes of ill health and thus
    doesn't want to encourage it among it's employees as well.\r\n\r\nWhatever, this

    And I would not say this was discrimination. Maybe the employer is covering his
    or her butt from a lawsuit. Some one in the work place might come along and say
    to the employer, â€œbecause you hired smokers, and I got lung cancer I am going
    to sue you.â€\x9D I guess that's just the way I look at it."

    Arenâ€™t you native american ? Lots and lots of cultures (and religions) smoke,
    sigarettes[sic] may not be very much used, but pipes are present in just about
    any religion. Even in Christianity there are (ancient) rituals that involve smoking.
    </blockquote>\r\n\r\nNative American religions involved a peace pipe, which wasn't
    smoked outside of the ritual itself. \r\n\r\nAs to Christianity, I'm not sure
    where the pipe would come in. Tobacco wouldn't have been smoked before the New
    World was discovered, so I guess you're trying to draw a connection between incense
    and smoking."

    a smoker?\r\nMost of the replies above focus on:\r\nIs legal, smoker are shit

    down to the insurance companies.  They're raising rates faster for smokers than
    they are for non-smokers, and that eats into cost.   Studies basically prove that
    smokers die at an alarmingly faster rate.  Even those who don't get cancer have

    religion! as I do not follow my parents religion being a passionate atheist. \r\n\r\nAnd
    they can also choose self inflicted disabilities such as obesity and don't give
    me all that jazz about how people can't help it as you can't possibly put on more
    weight than than the calorific content of what you eat. Obviously that should
    only affect employment opportunities in a few countries like the US where they
    don't have a state health structure and health plans are provided as job benefits,
    so I figure it should be okay to say no fatties and no chimneys, heck its their
    company they should be able to employ who they please.\r\n\r\nIncidentally I gave
    up smoking three years ago and for me its been a good thing but I wouldn't want
    to force that on others like the anti-smoking Nazi's around here.\r\n\r\n\"As
    an aside.. I recently had to visit a specialist medical practitioner with my daughter.
    She had a condition which was exacerbated by cigarette smoke. Neither my wife
    nor I smoke, but other family members do. The Professor we saw said that even
    if family members smoke outside, when they come in they continue to breathe out
    very nasty particulates over the rest of the family.\"\r\n\r\nStop it, Stop it,

    you down, and endangers everybody (that includes the smoker and the non-smokers).\r\n\r\nMy
    first wife died with lung cancer ans she was a passive smoker: her co-workers
    smoked, back when it was legal and ok/cool to smoke.\r\n\r\nI also find amusing

    You CANNOT take that right away from someone. Your point may be valid, but if
    the person wants to, they have the right to smoke. It's the same as if I want
    to, I have the right to shave my hair off..

<p>Some of you may know that I'm looking for a new job.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, I had a Phonecall from Kalamazoo Reynolds earlier, who, 3 questions into the interview asked.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Do you smoke?"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"Ok, then please feel free to re-apply if you ever give up, we have a company policy in place that we do not employ smokers"</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this legal?</p>
