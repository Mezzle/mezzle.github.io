<p>Last night, I released katapult 0.3.1.4, which is mainly a bugfix release, but well, It's a release!</p>
<p>We now have katapult working with amarok >=1.4.2 (and with < 1.4.2 still too!)</p>
<p>It was annoying, however, when my ISP decided to drop my connection for half an hour in the middle of pushing the files out to sourceforge.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.thekatapult.org.uk/">The Katapult</a> website for more details.</p>
<p>Packages will be available soon for feisty and sid</p>
