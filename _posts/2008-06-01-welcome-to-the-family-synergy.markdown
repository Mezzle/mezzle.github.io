  content: I name most of my system after bugs.  My primary desktop is scorpion and
    my notebook is wasp.  I broke this convention with my secondary desktop, which
    is called akavir (continent in the Elder Scrolls world).  My old notebook is still
    infected with the Microsoft virus, so it is currently nameless.  The servers at
    the college I attend are named after sci-fi stuff (largely Stargate).

  content: ! "I named the entire network in our house after errors.  The network name
    is \"errata\", and the computers are glitch, illegal-op, segfault, bsod and typo
    (my laptop).  I think there should be another name as well (bsod no longer exists,
    and I don't think I reused that name).\r\n\r\nThe computers at uni are often amusing.
    \ Looking through the hosts file for the university network shows themes such
    as politics (including inhabitations - town, city, village, hamlet - controlling
    positions/bodies - alderman, legislature, assembly, ambassador, chieftain - as
    well as misc. things like flag), scientists/mathematicians (darwin, euclid, curie,
    faraday, hooke), roman gods (vulcan, cupid, saturn), greek gods (apollo is particularly
    popular), theology (saints, books of the bible, religious terms), emotions, authors
    (milton, woolf, byron), cartoon / animation characters (dougal, ermintrude, zebedee,
    garfield, soupdragon, bagpuss), elements (hassium, hydrogen, hafnium), cake-like
    foods (cream-puff, sticky-bun, donut, jam-tart, battenberg), greek mythical characters
    (pandora, prometheus), children's story characters (daffy-duck, wendy, aunt-flo,
    cool-cat, buzz-lightyear - there's over 100 in this series in the maths department).\r\n\r\nOne
    department (biochemisty) I think has a theme for each section of the department
    - there are several such as mammals, birds, plants, fish, colours, musical notation,
    mythical creatures and shapes (pentahedroid, anyone?).\r\n\r\nOne place where
    most of the computers have the prefix \"bras\" has come up with names like \"brasknuckles\"
    and \"brassbullet\".\r\n\r\nThe computing department don't have a theme, just
    bizarre names like lasting-damange, mustard, evolution and sentinel."

    Pentium IV 3.0GHz (now in my sister's room) is \"XP1\" (also because it was running
    WinXP). No idea why the '1', not like I was planning to have a \"XP2\" anytime
    soon. This AMD Athlon dualcore was called \"dually\" while running Windows; reason
    being it's the first dualcore I own. Now it has Kubuntu and I still haven't bothered

    from the past.\r\nI named a pair of laptops Trogdor and Mercury.\r\nI had a stange
    little machine that was mostly scsi based and incredibly uncoperative that earned
    the name Troll.\r\nOne machine was so over clocked and possesed so many fans that
    it was named Fireblade.\r\nI had a machine which booted from a hard drive caddy
    that had each drive named after a different draconic body part, though Dragonsfire
    saw the most boot time.\r\n\r\nI actually compiled a list of names so I wasn't
    stuck thinking one up when I was installing.\r\nWhen you've had as many strong
    personality machines as I knocking around you start to get creative with the namings

<p>So - after my post about wanting a conference laptop - I went out and bought one today. I got myself a nice, large, Dual Core 17" Jobby. Ok, I've realised afterwards that it might be a bit of a gas guzzler, but, at least, as long as I have power, it should meet all my needs. And it's the first machine that I've had where, out of the box, everything works perfectly, and the first where I've been able to properly use the Desktop effects (Darn proprietary Video Cards!)</p>
<p>Anyway, along with this - I've now installed Ubuntu on it. Actual Ubuntu - rather than Kubuntu. This means that I now have nearly a full shipment of *buntu that I'm regularly using. Kubuntu @ work and on my desktop at home, Xubuntu on the eeePC, and Ubuntu on this new Laptop.</p>
<p>I also had fun thinking up another name for the laptop. I've called it synergy. Which basically means lots of small things working together to make something greater in whole than of it's component parts (Think of two muscles working together to give you a sort of idea) - The reason? Well - partly because my computer naming scheme revolves around the "I can't be bothered of thinking of a name" (put politely) - and - synergy, is of course, ultimate laziness, putting small things together to make something bigger (convoluted excuse I know!) and well - it completes my having what my idea of the 3 primary WM's are (Gnome, KDE, and XFCE), and means that my experience of Linux as a whole, is a more rounded and richer experience (Again, convoluted!) but anyway - here are my machines and what I call them (from the newest acquisition to the oldest)</p>
<ul>
<li>Synergy - The new "Conference" Laptop</li>
<li>Stupor - My VPS for running the important things on</li>
<li>Lethargy - My eeePC</li>
<li>Coma - My work PC</li>
<li>Anorak - Radio Amarok's primary server (named after a Radio Amarok inside joke)</li>
<li>Torpor - My "playground" VPS (where I keep all the non-critical stuff)</li>
<li>Apathy - My Home Desktop</li>
</ul>
<p>So - those are my machines, but, knowing that I have a similar naming schema to <a href="http://www.digital-scurf.org/">Daniel Silverstone</a>, it begs me to ask.</p>
<p>What do you call your machines and why?</p>
