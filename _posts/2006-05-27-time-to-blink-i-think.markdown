<p>Since my last blog post - I've been having a random conversation with somebody through the <a href="http://www.cheesenibbles.com/">thing I created</a>.</p>
<p>It's been random... very random.... though - apparently it's someone who I've met in person - so at least it isn't a cyber-stalker.</p>
<p>If anyone knows somene who went to UBZ with a .fi domain name, let me know please? :P</p>
