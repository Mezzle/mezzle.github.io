<p><img title="I'm off to LUGRadio Live 2006" style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px" alt="I'm off to LUGRadio Live 2006" src="http://silenceisdefeat.org/~barbobot/lugradio/badge_exhibiting2.png" align="right" />Well, I'm off to see some wizards anyway.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I'm going to be hopping on a bus and heading on over to Wolverhampton to go see four large gents and a load of geeks make fools of themselves.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know what it is LUGRadio Live is an annual event driven by, and for the Open Source community. The event includes a range of speakers, exhibitors and other attractions, all housed within a unique event with a unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>Specifically, it's an Open Source community conference... but it's a little more... relaxed than most. If you've ever listened to any of the LugRadio shows - then you should know what kind of things will happen. Mainly lots of swearing and getting drunk.</p>
<p>I'm going to be helping out on the KDE/Kubuntu Stand - hence the "exhibiting" button. I'm also helping with the A/V work (filming talks etc) and hopefully running the GPG Keysigning BoF. Plus I'm sure i'll be doing other things - I always seem to volunteer to help out.</p>
<p>Anyway - if anyone's going to be there - feel free to come over and say hi at the Kubuntu Stand and have a chat!</p>
