<p>Ever since I first got involved in iFolder - I've never managed to get Simias to build properly inside a chroot.</p>
<p>A sense of overwhelming achievement came across me today when I finally had this happen</p>
<blockquote><p><code> dpkg-genchanges: including full source code in upload<br />
dpkg-buildpackage: full upload (original source is included)<br />
Copying back the cached apt archive contents<br />
-> unmounting dev/pts filesystem<br />
-> unmounting proc filesystem<br />
Current time: Tue Feb 14 00:22:51 GMT 2006<br />
pbuilder-time-stamp: 1139876571<br />
-> cleaning the build env<br />
-> removing directory /scratch/cache/pbuilder/build//21686 and its subdirectories</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, so everything may not be cool - I've just realised there are some thing in libsimias0 that should be in libsimias-dev - but hey - that's the smallest issue I've ever had.</p>
<p>You have NO idea how ... relieved this has made me feel. To finally have an actual fully built simias package. I'm really hoping that this is the final step - that I don't come across anything else. Because, for those of you who've been following my struggle with iFolder over the past <em>x</em> months will know it hasn't been a pretty one. Much to the fact that the Novell Code/my packaging have always been at a stage where they disagree with each other... but now they finally agree... now - onto iFolder itself... which is currently building nicely... lets just hope it'll build in a chroot ;)</p>
<p>*crosses fingers and hopes*</p>
