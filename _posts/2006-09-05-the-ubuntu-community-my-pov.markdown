  content: The person with the negative comment about the community has a blog called
    worsethanhitler.com -- and he behaves exactly like that. I don't consider it elitism
    to be careful about the behaviour that's tolerated in the channel.

  content: You should blog about rosseta an the kde translation. This is... about
    the rants in translators list because ubuntu has packaged forked and outdated
    kde translations.

<p>Recently Scott James Remnant <a title="Scott James Remnant: Having Left Debian" href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/tech/debian/having_left_debian.html">blogged</a> about his leaving of the Debian Project.</p>
<p>Reading this, I was sad to read how he felt that Debian's conduct to Ubuntu Developers was wrong, and partly, I agree. But I would also like to say that although there are certain individuals within the Debian Community who are VERY anti-ubuntu, a LOT of them are not. I've found quite a few Debian Developers who are more than willing to help out, and although I get shot down sometimes in #debian-devel, and yes, I do ask a lot of stupid questions in a lot of stupid places, generally, the Debian community isn't as elitist as many people think.</p>
<p>I also think that, although it doesnt come across a lot, the Ubuntu Community can come across as pretty elitist to. From my own experiences, I've seen a lot of elitism, there are people who will (no names mentioned) shoot down people for not being the "brightest" of the bunch.</p>
<p>The thing I ask is that everyone remembers that there are new people coming to Linux all the time. There are people from ubuntu who want to try something a little different, and want to try debian, there are people (like me) who want to contribute to both Debian and Ubuntu (but, unlike me, give up trying after their first bad experience of the "inter-distro" tension).</p>
<p>The Ubuntu community on the whole does a superb job in welcoming new people to the fold, as shown by Pete Savage's <a title="Pee Savage: Definately the place to be!" href="http://www.progbox.co.uk/wordpress/?p=132">latest blog.</a> However, in some cases, it falls below par, just as a lot of other places do (as shown by a coment on Pete Savage's blog).</p>
<p>I'd like to see  more people working towards helping new users get into Linux. There's a wealth of people out there who just need a little help, and by giving them that little help, they're more likely to contribute back in the future.</p>
<p>A few of you may know about the "<a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUserNetwork">New User Network</a>" in ubuntu -  this is a team of "mentors" set up to help new users come to grips with Ubuntu, and Linux. Recently, it was <a title="Linux.com : Ubuntu turns to NUN to help new users" href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/08/2042213">featured on linux.com</a>. I implore everyone reading this who wants to help increase the friendliness of the Ubuntu Community, whether you be a new user yourself, or an old hack, to join the NUN. It's a great project, and it's <a href="https://launchpad.net/people/newusernetwork/+members">growing rapidly</a>, and I like to think we're making a difference.</p>
<p>If you're interested in joining, feel free to talk to myself or nalioth on IRC, or join #ubuntu-nun, or make a post to the <a href="mailto:ubuntu-nun@lists.ubuntu.com">ubuntu-nun mailing list</a></p>
<p>Anyway, that's my rambling over... now <a href="http://planet.ubuntu.com/">go read some more geek blogs</a></p>
