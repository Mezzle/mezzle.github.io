  content: ! "I have LP as my OpenID provider for SO, and I can still login and use
    it as normal.\r\n\r\nBut I have always specified \"https://login.launchpad.net\"
    instead of the specific LP user URL."

<p>A site I use quite regularly is <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - a great, community driven site for programmers.</p>
<p>At this site, you get rep when you post good answers, or good questions, which are voted up by the others on the site.</p>
<p>Imagine my dismay, when, this morning, I tried to <a href="http://launchpad.net/~mez">login using the normal URL that I use for OpenID logins</a>, only to find that the URL that it is delegated to has changed.</p>
<p>"What does this mean?" I might hear you asking.</p>
<p>Well, it means that anyone who's using Launchpad as their OpenID Provider (OP) doesn't have their openID assosciated to them anymore. For me, this means I can no longer access my stackoverflow account and my reputation starts at 1 again.</p>
<p>*sigh* - while I can understand that LP's OpenID implementation is still in Beta, I don't expect changes that completely change the way the system works. It's paramount to going through the system and changing everyone's username.... :(</p>
<p>I'm pretty annoyed at this, and have <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/294634">filed a bug about it.</a></p>
<p>Edit: It seems they've removed the delegation on the pages for users, and This is why it's happening...</p>
