<p>A while back, I wrote a <a href="http://www.sourceguru.net/archives/30" target="_blank">post</a> saying that I'd be away for some time.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say that within the next few weeks I'll be heading back and resuming my role(s) under the many projects I've undertaken.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are a few things that I definately need to get up to date on. And they're my priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thekatapult.org.uk" target="_blank">Katapult</a> - This needs a little love and attention, the bzr branches syncing with SVN and a few other things.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports">Backports</a> - It was slightly annoying while I was away reading a tutorial someone wrote in a magazine and reading the words "and the ubuntu backports repositories gave no help either". I want to get this running again. I'm going to be badgering people to get on with working on things that need to be done (sorting out soyuz to do the backports mainly) so that backports can be back to what it used to be</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUserNetwork">New User Network</a> - it seems while I've been away that nalioth has done a lot of good work on the NUN... including #ubuntu-classroom and getting an article on linux.com While he's done good work, I need to get up to scratch with what's going on and fix things</li>
<li>Email - I've got a ton of unread email sitting in my inbox(es) which I need to catch up on. If you've sent me anything important lately please re-send it... I may just have to do a bulk delete (when I last checked there were 12,000 emails waiting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well. If you need me, I'll be around on IRC... I hope to be hearing from you all soon, and hopefully not people moaning at me to fix things.</p>
