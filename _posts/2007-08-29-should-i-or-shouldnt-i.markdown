  content: ! 'As long as it pertains to Linux / Ubuntu, I don''t have issue. Seems
    though that there are times that planet.ubuntu.com seems to get swamped with useless
    drivel just because someone decided to put thier entire site on feed.


    I don''t want to know about someone''s vacation, hardtimes, rockband, etc. when
    I go to planet Ubuntu. I go there for Ubuntu newsbits and articles and of course
    the occasional noteworthly linux tidbit. I don''t have enough time to follow multiple
    Linux news sites on a daily /multi-daily basis so I tend to go to feed sites like
    planet Ubuntu and follow articles that have specific interest. If some guy is
    flooding planet with his vacation stories, something worthwhile might actually
    get pushed off too fast and a lot of people might miss it. That''s really irritating.


    What I''m trying to say or better yet ask is: Is there no way to segregate the
    feeds so items that pertain to Ubuntu/Linux get fed to planet Ubuntu and other
    such linux-specific sites and "My vacation" feeds get fed to some other site(s)
    that cater to general social stories?'

    quiz.  I for one have enjoyed the giggles - and my giggle was not at the lady
    in particular, but at the fact she was compared to herself.

    If I''m wrong, forgive the assumption - but I would love to see the giggles continue.  I
    too, have been giggling.'

    what I've been doing (mostly b/c of political posts and the like), so I have a
    separate Planet category that is the only one syndicated, instead of my main feed.

  content: I have always welcomed a giggle every once in a while. It's nice after
    browsing news that Microsoft buys votes for OOXML. Giggles keep me sane. As long
    as it's short and doesn't take more than a few seconds to get to the punchline,
    it's all good. In fact, I'd like to thank you for the giggles thus far.

<p>Over the last couple of days, I've been posting a few things that have made me giggle, to share with the outer world.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've had a complaint, so I'd like to know from you guys and gals whether you think I should continue doing so?</p>
