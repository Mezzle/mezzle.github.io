  content: ! "Well, you should not (never!) partition a md-device. Very bad things
    will happen, if you try (which you just experienced).\r\n\r\nTrust me, your setup
    is not very exotic or special, you just need to follow a strict order:\r\n\r\n1)
    setup _all_ partitions\r\n2) setup every md-device\r\n2a) never partition a md-device.\r\n2b)
    no, don't do it, really!\r\n3) configure LVM\r\n4) profit\r\n\r\nI've done similar
    setups using the installer, worked like a charm."

  content: I can't even get raid to work.  Click F6 in windows and loading a driver
    is FAR EASIER than raid with Ubuntu.  Alan Pope did some videos about install
    raid a while back and I tried it with no success.  It would be great to get updated
    screencast/videos up explaining this with 8.10 from scratch. (FYI this is from
    a user's perspective).

  content: ! "I've had quite bad experiences with LVM, also in the combination with
    software raids (raid not starting after reboot, magically changing uuids, unable
    to assemble array although the devices are there, etc.) \r\nI don't know if i've
    been unlucky, but I stopped using LVM completely. IMHO it's just not worth it."

  content: ! "I think LVM is the best invention since pre-sliced bread.\r\n\r\nI used
    it since the old 2.2.x days, when it was an addon patch to the kernel.\r\n\r\nRight
    now all my servers (several mail-storage setups in the multi-TB size, Xen-Hosts,
    multi-purpose systems, etc.) are setup using MD-RAID with LVM on top.\r\n\r\nMost
    people which had severe problems using LVM had a) faulty hardware, b) an error
    in their way of thinking or c) tried to use it in a way or for a purpose it was
    not designed for.\r\n\r\nMy setup normally looks like this:\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nroot@XYZ-1:~#

    auto\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nOn the first partition is /dev/md0,
    which is / (root), while the third partition formes /dev/md1, where my LVM resides:\r\n\r\nroot@XYZ-1:~#
    lvscan\r\n  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg03/backup_lv' [1.09 TB] inherit\r\n  ACTIVE
    \           '/dev/vg02/home_lv' [1.00 TB] inherit\r\n  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg01/usr_lv'
    [4.00 GB] inherit\r\n  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg01/var_lv' [4.00 GB] inherit\r\n
    \ ACTIVE            '/dev/vg01/tmp_lv' [4.00 GB] inherit\r\n  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg01/vartmp_lv'

    \ ACTIVE            '/dev/vg01/log_lv' [6.00 GB] inherit\r\n\r\n(vg02 and vg03
    are on a FibreChannel storage array.)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I not even using
    the full 72GB of vg01. But if I ever need a bigger /var/log or some other filesystem,
    I can resize or create one, without the need of fiddling with partitions. And,
    this is the best part: I don't need to shutdown or reboot the machine. This is
    why I use LVM."

  content: You can give the recent openSUSE release (11.1) a try, complex stuff like
    raid+lvm should be supported out of the box and the partitioning configuration
    has been much improved lately.

    about what we are supposed to do after that?"

<p>Ok, so working with RAID and LVM is... well... not easy.</p>
<p>I have three hard drives in this machine, all of different sizes, (160Gb, 200Gb, and 300Gb), and I'm gong to be setting these up so that I have aÂ  RAID-5 made up of three 160Gb Partitions, (with LVM on top) a RAID-1 Partition of 40Gb (no LVM) and the rest split between boot, swap, and misc.</p>
<p>However, the ubuntu alternative CD doesn't make this easy, and, one of my favourite annoyances is that once you configure RAID, you cannot make changes to the partitions on the disk where you have RAID partitions :( (hidden away in the middle of a block of text that people aren't likely to read... I only spotted it on the 4th/5th attempt)</p>
<p>Getting RAID setup is fine, getting RAID+LVM has taken me... 6 attempts so far, and I think that I've managed to say the right prayers to the right gods this time... or maybe not...</p>
<p>"The kernel was unable to re-read the partititon table on /dev/md1 (Invalid argument). This means Linux won't know anything about the modifications you made until you reboot. you should reboot your computer before doing anything with /dev/md1</p>
<p>Maybe I should do this manually *clicks reboot*</p>
