  content: ! "Altough I liked Mutt a lot in history, it was very confusing and \"too
    simple\" by it's ideas. I wanted to use pine but it was dificult to configure
    for scandinavians letters and I found new version from it, called alpine. So far
    it is best email application for commandline what I have used. Blazing fast and
    very intuitive even for old people. \r\n\r\nScreen + irssi + alpine + centerim
    + rtorrent + mc + ssh + mplayer and you get almost everything done. Altought that
    command line web-browsers are still bretty bad. All videos and music is easy to
    play and you can just enjoy using computer, even it would be old like PII !"

  content: ! "santiago. I'm happy with KDE/Gnome, and irssi does what I need. No idea
    about a feed reader, but there are probably patches for mutt. Also, I don't keep
    the mails on my lappy, or my PC, they're on my server ;) so I have that \"permanent
    connection\" thing going :D\r\n\r\nethana2, if pidgin does what you need, then
    great :D but I find that it doesn't for me. I'm what I'd like to think of as an
    advanced IRC user, so I need a lot more flexibility, that pidgin doesn't give
    me :D I do use pidgin currently as my IM client, but I don't see IRC as an IM
    protocol\r\n\r\nFabian - ah yes, finch - I'll have to try that out sometime, but
    I've not really heard good things about it."

  content: I think this setup is quite common among advanced user. Could you provide
    your configurations (for irssi, screen, mutt), it would be nice samples.

    reading through all the documentation and using several different setups (one

<p>Ok, so, some of you may know that I recently switched from using Xchat + ctrl_proxy to irssi for my main IRC connection. I did this as I'd been pestered literally thousands of times to "get a real IRC client".</p>
<p>While I don't agree with this philosophy (Xchat <strong>IS</strong> a real IRC client!), I have to admit, I've not regretted switching to irssi! Combining it with screen means that I can see the same IRC session from anywhere, and using irssi gives me quite a few cool new features (I'm a HUGE fan of regexes!). So, irssi, after getting used to switching channels, and managing everything is great for me. I can now authenticate to OFTC using SSL, I can use IPv6, and many many other things. Slick.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I've said, I also use screen. This is one of the best tools ever created by man. It's increased my productivity, and it's so simplistic to use.</p>
<p>So, why am I writing this now?</p>
<p>Well, over the past few ways, I've finally got around to using mutt for the first time, and while it's not as pretty as some of the email clients you get out there, it does exactly what I need. And, although I've spent the last 2 days tweaking my configuration, getting confused, rereading the mutt manual, shouting and swearing, getting even more confused, rereading the mutt manual again, I've found that mutt, for me, is actually an email client that does what I want it to.</p>
<p>For example, using mutt, I now no longer have to worry that I'll send an email to a mailing list using the wrong address, I can subscribe to a better "Inbox Zero" philosophy (Inbox Zero Status: 0!) and managing my email seems to come more naturally.</p>
<p>Mutt may be hard to get used to, a pain to configure just the way you want it, but, in the end, it makes sense. I'd reccomend everyone try it at least once!</p>
<p>So, yeah, I've moved my ubuntu email address over to mutt (in a screen window alongside irssi!) and will be moving the others just as soon as I can be bothered to goto all the different places and combine my .procmailrc. But I've made a start, and, for the forseeable future, it'll be my mail client of choice.</p>
<p>It seems though, I'm spending a lot more time in an xterm than I am in anything else.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start using bitlbee too ;)</p>
