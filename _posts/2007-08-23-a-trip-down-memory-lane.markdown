  content: One has to keep in mind that the brain selectively remembers things that
    are important, and throws away most of the junk. Thus if I think back to 2002
    I remember partying a lot and going to Berlin, thinking about 2007 a lot of it
    has been spent drawing, hacking, etc. quietly in a room somewhere. This doesn't
    mean 2002 was better than 2007, it just means that partying and going to Germany
    stick in my head because they were cool, whereas sitting in a room hacking sticks
    in my head because it only just happened, even though I've been to LUG Radio Live
    and GUADEC and other cool things, and partied a hell of a lot at University (and
    reflecting on the past is often done at times when we're feeling down, thus making
    the immediate present more incredibly awful than it actually is). Unless something
    catastrophic happens then the present is usually better than the past (and even
    then, the 'great' past mustn't have been that great if it built up to a catastrophe).
    That's not to say that everything is perfect now, but that things used to be worse
    but we've forgotten about that because we're past it now. Plus we may set our
    standards and goals higher as we progress, thus making our lives seem much harder
    than they were when in fact we're just trying harder for more difficult goals.
    For instance I got more worked up and stressed by meaningless exams in high school
    than I ever have at University, but hindsight can be dangerous because it is far
    too easy to 'remember' high school stress by just applying my current thinking
    to the situation and coming to the conclusion that is wasn't too bad. Just something
    to think about :)

<p>It's amazing what can cause a trip down memory lane.</p>
<p>The other day at work, a girl walked in who looked a lot like my Ex girlfriend of about 4 years ago could look like now, and it sent me back on a trip down memory lane.</p>
<p>By gods, I miss the good old days, when life was easy, and there wasn't so much FUD to deal with all the time.</p>
<p>Long live the past I say *drifts off back down memory lane*</p>
<p>(oh, and Miz, if you read this, get in touch!)</p>
