  content: ! '[...] On a slightly different subject The release of Ubuntu 6.04 (Dapper)
    is coming up.. I had hoped that Compiz and Xgl would be in it but my hopes are
    dashed (at least officially, I fully expect it to be in the Backports project
    before very long). What I have found out is that Compiz, Xgl and sections of iFolder
    will be in Dapper+1 (the October release this year). Now that is a release I will
    be _very_ much looking forward to. Check out the video on Xgl and Compiz goodness..
    I&#8217;m going to have to upgrade to Dapper unstable just so i can see some of
    this fantastic GUIness [...]'

<p>So, the last couple of days I've hopped back onto the iFolder train - and have been doing a lot of work.</p>
<p>It's quite a scary program really... It's got so much stuff in it.</p>
<p>I've found that to have a basic iFolder Server install it's 36Mb ... big eh ?</p>
<p>Anyways - things are going good - I've got libflaim (new and open sourced) built :D and well - the other package (log4net) seems to being wubbed in debian - so will appear for dapper+1 in ubuntu - and debian pretty soon (theres no way I can get iFolder into dapper easily - so I'm not going to try!)</p>
<p>But yeah - hopefully we'll see some nice iFolder packages being made in the near future - and it's going to add 4 packages to my list of packages I maintain in debian - yay! (and erk!)</p>
<p>Hopefully - I'll get a sponsor pretty easily for it - the debian mono team are uber people - and have helped me a lot - plus - It seems a DD is already interested in packaging it - so well - should be able to work with him.</p>
<p>Kudos to the iFolder people though - they work hard on bringing you the best they can - and well - they're  alot better at working with the community than some other projects are :D</p>
<p>Anyhoo - well - I hope Jorge will be happy about all this.</p>
<p>Gah - now I just need to get my website sorted out :D</p>
