<p>Due to the fact that my previous VPS was well out of date (Ubuntu Intrepid!!!) - I'm currently in the process of moving everything to a new server.</p>
<p>I've had lots of fun re-setting up my email - and it's now very shiny and easy for me to use :) (I'll be writing a tutorial at some point in the near future)</p>
<p>Other than that - I'd like to give a quick shameless plug to my VPS provider, <a href="http://www.bitfolk.com/">Bitfolk</a>.  They're awesome, and have a <a href="https://tools.bitfolk.com/wiki/Migrating_to_a_new_VPS">great policy for Migrating to a new VPS</a>.</p>
