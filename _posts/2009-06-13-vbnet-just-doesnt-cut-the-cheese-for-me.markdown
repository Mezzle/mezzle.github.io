  content: ! "Basic is an inferior language for beginners as well. I'm teaching my
    girlfriend programming this summer, since she starts a Library Science program
    in the fall and will probably have to do some. We checked out a couple of Computer
    Science 101 textbooks that use python as their main language. We've only done
    a few chapters but its gone fairly quickly. Much less painful from when I taught
    myself programming by spending the whole damn summer reading \"Learn to Program
    C++ in 21 Days\". :D\r\n\r\nSo I think its a great beginner language. It has real
    OO, but you can also avoid defining classes and just use static methods to begin
    with. And having the interpreter is pretty much required for any beginning language
    in my opinion since its a great way to try out new syntax. Once she understands
    the programming basics I plan to introduce PyQt. This was the environment I actually
    originally learned Qt in. :)\r\n\r\nSo these days I don't really see what role
    Basic has to play.\r\n\r\nI suppose I do hold a similar opinion with Ada as you
    do with Basic. Ada was used as the language for my CS major, which I think was
    fine since its very structured and a very good procedural programming language.
    But then it got totally silly when one of the more advanced CS classes introduced
    OOP in the context of Ada. OOP is Ada is just freakin' weird. :)"

    you are discusing different languages VB.NET can be considered to be C# with a
    funny syntax. Sure there are minor differences between them but nothing that would
    make one or the other inherently worse than the other.\r\n\r\nThe isssue most
    people have with maintaining VB.Net code is that it's often written bad programmers
    which  is something the VB-community DOES have more of than for example C#. \r\n\r\nDon't
    blame the machines or the languages, blame the people responible for writing the
    piece of crap you are responsible for maintaining."

    \ Ok, it might do some basic stuff OO well, but if you get along the lines of
    inheritance, or anything remotely beyond just keeping variables in an object,
    it can get very complex, and really hard to understand.\r\n\r\nBasic is designed
    as a linear programming language. Shoe-horning OO concepts into the language that's
    not designed to be OO is never a good idea."

  content: I started writing in BASIC, moved on to VB6, and now write in VB.NET.  I
    love it.  Sometimes I have to write in C# or even C++ for work and I always think
    how i could write the code faster or better in VB.NET. I even convinced my employer
    once to let me re-write a device driver in VB that was written in C++, and my
    driver ran faster.  But VB.NET &amp; C# are piratically the same language. Most
    of the time you just have to drop the semi-Colin and the code becomes VB.  I also
    love using inheritance which I think is easy to understand in VB.

  content: Sorry but you are obviously unfamiliar with VB and mistaking your personal
    prejudices for natural laws. I  code in both languages and I have never, ever
    been in a situation where I could not do something in one that i could not do
    equally well and equally efficiently in the other. If either language has any
    advantage it is in VB's verbosity which allows it to be maintained somewhat more
    easily.

<p>So, this morning (or yesterday morning, as it is now!), my attention got drawn to <a href="http://blog.manticore-uk.com/2009/06/08/the-great-vbnet-horror/">Wolfgang's post regarding VB.Net</a>. While I understand his point, I'm not too sure whether I agree with it in it's entirity.</p>
<p>When I first started programming, I learnt how to write Basic. I don't mean Basic as it stands nowadays, but Basic as it was back then (or should that be BASIC?). I learnt to code while I was wheelchair bound, as my father thought it'd be something interesting for me to do. It taught me the basics of programming, and I stemmed from there, moving on to learn Perl, then PHP, then C, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>The first time I ever wrote an application for a Modern computer, I wrote it in Visual Basic. I loved it. It was so simple to use, and I could use everything I'd learnt (apart from stuff like Music Envelopes etc etc) with ease in it.</p>
<p>Since then however, the world of programming has moved on. People have discovered Object Oriented programming, and found new and better ways of describing the data structures and logic behind an application. I have also moved on, I no longer write my own code in Visual Basic. I'll generally use a tool more suited to the task.</p>
<p>I do, however, have to maintain some VB.Net code. In fact, it's the code that Wolfgang mentions in his article. I can fully understand why the original subject's response was "Urgh!" - the code is horrid.</p>
<p>I don't neccesarily, however, think that this is because of the coders themselves. While this may have contributed (I've had many a "WTF" moment) - I think that the main problem behind it is the fact that it's an Object Oriented design written in a language that's tried to shoehorn Object Orientation into it's core functionality, where the core functionality should probably never have had something like that done to it. It sits in my mind like some bad genetic experience resulting in some sort of mutated behemoth.</p>
<p>VB.Net, to me, just seems like a poorly made implementation of something it was never originally designed for. Wolfgang mentions that the ease of use of the Basic Language allows a user to start working without having to dive straight into OO programming, as would be forced onto you using something like C#, and in a way, I agree. The thing is, that Basic, as Wolfgang rightly said, is meant for beginners, after all, it was originally an acronym. "Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code". This, in my opinion, is where it should stay. Basic is great for beginners, and VB6 was amazing. But, the advent of VB.Net means that programmers are going to start writing OO code in Basic, something it was never designed for, and to that end, fall into pitfalls and misconceptions where they have been led to believe that the VB.Net way of doing something is the de-facto standard. When they come to start working in another language, they have to re-learn things from scratch. If their experience is in a corporate environment, then their skills are only transferrable to something <em>also</em> written in VB.Net, and rarely anything else.</p>
<p>Basic is for beginners, it was never designed for the more complex stuff, which should probably be left to languages that were designed to handle it.</p>
