<p>I've finally.... after god knows how long, got my internet sorted out at home.</p>
<p>Thanks to the guys at <a href="http://www.webtapestry.net/">WebTapestry</a> for providing excellent support and Internet access where others said they couldn't</p>
<p>Also thanks to <a href="http://neuro.me.uk/">neuro</a> for recommending them.</p>
<p>Expect to see more of me around the net now ;)</p>
<p>Oh, and it was nice when I opened my router to see a copy of the GPL staring up at me</p>
