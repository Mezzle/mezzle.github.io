  content: ! 'Would you be able to get me something that would let me install iFolder
    on my Dapper Server? I have tried using multiple bits of information,including
    the Ubuntu Forums and the iFolder Dapper HowTo. I do not have a working install
    so far. So, any help you could provide with an apt repository or anything else
    would be great. I figure you got my email from this comment. If not then email
    me at epicurusv[at]gmail[dot]com.


    Thanks,

    Joe'

<p>So ... after finally getting everything ready for ifolder - I've finally actually made an apt repository for it :D</p>
<p>I have limited bandwidth however, so until Novell decide to mirror it - it'll be restricted.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to grab a copy of iFolder, please feel free to email me and I'll send you the details of the apt repository.</p>
<p>Please note, that this is currently only for ubuntu dapper. I will however, be adding sid, etch, sarge and breezy repositories soon ... well - if they build :D</p>
<p>oh yeah - mez _AT_ ubuntu _DOT_ com</p>
