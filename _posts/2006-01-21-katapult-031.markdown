<p>Well... it's been a long time in the coming - but we've finally managed to make the first release of katapult - a program we stole from another developer (with his permission of course) and developed specifically for kubuntu.</p>
<p>The Feedback for it has been outstanding so far (<a title="katapult on kde-apps.org" href="http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=33985">see the page on kde-apps.org</a>) and it seems to be going well. It's amazing how such a simple program can be so useful.</p>
<p>I'm glad to be part of the katapult team. It's great to be able to help people, and it's a very cool application - I find it very hard when it's not around (when I was in windows the other day - I tried to run firefox - I  tried alt+space, alt+f2 alt+f1 before I finally realised it was windows and none of those shortcuts worked!) It's amazing how dependent I've become upon it.</p>
<p>Anyway - I can't wait for the next release - hopefully it'll be even more uber than this one :D</p>
<p>Oh yeah - and hopefully we'll be seeing it as my first debian package soon too ;)</p>
