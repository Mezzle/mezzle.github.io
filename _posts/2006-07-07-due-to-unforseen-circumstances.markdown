<p>I am taking a "vacation" from all things linux.</p>
<p>I don't know how long this will last - but i'll still be around in an emergency.</p>
<p>I'll be contacting people in the next few days to delegate jobs etc to them.</p>
<p>I hope I'll be back soon - but I can't promise anything.</p>
<p>I'm still off to LUGRadio Live 2006 though</p>
