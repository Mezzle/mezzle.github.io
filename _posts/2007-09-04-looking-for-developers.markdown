<p>I'm looking for Developers who are experienced in the following fields, and have some time on their hand to possibly work on a new project I've had an idea for.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jabber/XMPP</li>
<li>Linux/Windows Cross Compatibility</li>
<li>Streaming Audio</li>
<li>SIP/Similar Technologies</li>
<li>Jack or Similar/Windows Equivalent</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept is based around an online radio station management system, allowing DJs flawless integration with each other to allow seamless changeovers, multiple DJs etc etc.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me on martin AT sourceguru DOT net if you're interested and would like to know more.</p>
