<p>No, I'm not going to have a part 2.0 :P</p>
<p>Couple of quotes from tonight.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Only at LUGRadio Live would you find someone doing a Linux install at 9pm in a pub"</p>
<p>"and then putting the CD back in a holster he has attached to his trousers"</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess who was doing the install ... :P</p>
<p>Then Dave2Â  arrived, and the conversation switched to well, goatse., and then to Tubgirl</p>
<blockquote><p>"What's Tubgirl"</p>
<p>"you've never seen tubgirl"</p>
<p>"no"</p>
<p>"Ok guys, get your cameras out for a reaction shot"</p>
<p>*fiddling with Mobile Internet ensues*</p>
<p>"Ok, ready? 1... 2... 3..."</p>
<p>"What the **** is going on there" ... "oh, actually, she's kinda hot"</p></blockquote>
<p>Only at LUGRadio</p>
