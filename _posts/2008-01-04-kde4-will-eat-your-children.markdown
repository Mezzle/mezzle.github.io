    shows that it really won''t eat your children"

  content: ! "You are quoting out of context. The full quote is:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In
    the open source method you release early, you release often. By doing so, a progression
    is presented that people can follow with fairly blunt (often overly pessimistic)
    guidance along with it, e.g.: \"foobar v 0.0.1: will eat your children\".</blockquote>"
