  content: ! "Personally I'd have just asked why they didn't mention Linux. My gut
    tells me it's pretty clear though -- if you're comparing Mac to Windows why would
    you bring up another thing? It's not relevant to deciding if Mac or Windows is
    better.\r\n\r\nThe Wall of Fame section just takes two things and put them head
    to head. You shouldn't feel sad if the iPod v Walkman comparison didn't mention
    iRiver.\r\n\r\nThe Gadget Show does cover Linux on occasion -- just not this one."

  content: This will go straight over their heads, of course. "What? We can't spend
    lots of money on it, get it on special offer, or negotiate a discount? How can
    I get my consumer buzz?" That's what The Gadget Show and similar output is all
    about.

    PC World.\r\n\r\nStopped watching yonks ago.  Would be interested to hear any

    Gear (which the program is clearly aiming to copy to some extent).\r\n\r\nIf they
    did mention Linux they would only display the the sort of superficial arguments
    that were used for Win vs. Mac and the result would be just as annoying."

  content: ! "Why they should mention Linux there? Linux is not a PC, like NT is not
    PC either. If we would think that the OS is just a one component among other computer
    components, then we get the point that NT is the OS what makes personal computer
    a PC. The original PC had PC-DOS what was MS's own OS and they sold it separately
    as MS-DOS. Linux did not even exist than after 10 years when the IBM created the
    PC. PC born 1981 when IBM released IBM PC. Macintosh was released by Apple 1984.
    Linux was born by 1991 by Linus Torvalds.\r\n\r\nThe PC has always meant the specific
    kind personal computer and comes with operating system and system programs what
    is manufactured by MS. The PC's idea was to offer a modular personal computer
    where you could change every part to wanted from original one.\r\n\r\nSo even
    that these days you can install easily a any distribution of the Linux OS (= kernel).
    The PC refers to personal computer what is sold as PC and comes windows preinstalled."

  content: ! "The whole things was a laugh from start to finish, they were comparing
    hardware, so what does this have to do with software? The winner was correct however
    it should have been IBM PC vs Apple Mac, which ever came first and sold well should
    be the winner!\r\n\r\nNext they should have the Windows vs OS competition, I blame
    Apples stupid advertising campaign for making people think a Mac is different
    from a PC when its only a case of Windows vs OSX."

<p>Today, an episode of "<a href="http://five.tv/gadget-show/">The Gadget Show</a>" aired in which they compared PC and Mac to put on their "wall of fame".</p>
<p>I was shocked that there was no mention of Linux <strong>at all</strong> in their rundown.</p>
<p>Here is the email I just sent to them in response to the show:-</p>
<blockquote><p>Date: Mon, 30 Nov 2009 22:16:28 +0000<br />
From: Martin Meredith &lt;mez AT debian DOT org&gt;<br />
To: gadget.show AT northonetv DOT com<br />
Subject: PC vs Mac - Yes, you mention windows</p>
<p>But both PC's and Mac's have the ability to run a little thing called "Linux"</p>
<p>Linux is the base of an operating system that's been around for years, often<br />
making innovations BEFORE Windows or Mac are able to.</p>
<p>It's an Operating system that's written by the people, for the people, which<br />
shows in the fact that there are hundreds (if not thousands) of distributions<br />
available to download and use - for FREE!!!!</p>
<p>A large motive behind the Linux movement is the fact that it's completely free.<br />
Both in the sense of Free Speech, and in the sense of Free Beer.  You don't have to pay for it, and you can do what you like with it.</p>
<p>Compare the above to a Mac.  With a mac, you're limited to the hardware you can use, you're limited in the functionality, etc etc.  Comparing to Windows, you can see the benefit of the price.  Constantly upgrading windows can cost a LOT of money.</p>
<p>Ok, Linux does have it's flaws.  Some hardware isn't supported correctly, and a lot of the software you'll find on the shelves of your local shop probably won't work with it.  But, nowadays, with the advent of the iPhone, and to a lesser extent, Android based Mobile Phones, people are coming to expect easily available software.</p>
<p>Enter the package Manager.  Most distributions of Linux now offer an easy way to find and install applications,  and some go a step further and give you an application that makes life even easier (See attached screenshot)</p>
<p>Linux also has the benefit that, like the Mac, the fact that it's not Windows,<br />
and something that 90%+ of people use, it's not a target for Viruses.  Add that<br />
to the fact that it has Least Privileged Access built in (Think Windows Vista<br />
"are you sure that you want to run this program as an admin?"), and has done<br />
since the very beginning, and it makes it one of the most secure operating<br />
systems you can find.</p>
<p>Linux has come along in leaps and bounds in recent years, and is surely a<br />
competitor for any operating system out there.  While it may be unfamiliar,<br />
with the advent of new technology, it's perfectly placed.  This has been shown<br />
by the fact that until Microsoft made a sly move to relicence Windows XP for<br />
netbooks, it was hard to find a netbook with anything but a Linux based OS on it (and all those who tried out my eeePC 701 when it was new and shiny out of the box tended to prefer what was on that than Windows!)</p>
