  content: I've found Kaffeine to be a uniformly worthless piece of garbage for years.
    It doesn't play anything for me, ever.

  content: Personally, I like Kaffeine, and it has served me well for quite a while.  It
    looks like your installation of Kaffeine may be messed up, especially if Xine
    works, but Kaffeine doesn't.  As a work-around, you could use VLC.  It may not
    be as nice in some ways, but at least it should be usable.

<p>Ok, now it seems that I can play videos in Xine.. but not in kaffeine I managed to do this by switching to openGl mode ni Xine itself... however, kaffeine won't allow me to do that.</p>

<p>Any ideas? (It's good, I can now watch my movies!- Â but I prefer Kaffeine's GUI!)</p>
