  content: ! "\"the â€œwinning number displayâ€\x9D crashes. Leaving an xterm on screen.\"\r\nNice
    to know that the company who made it (ACE systems, was it?) have many talented
    developers. What did they do, copy code from Ark, Enlightenment and Warsow (The
    most unstable GNU/Linux software I know of)? :P\r\n\r\nStill, better than using
    proprietary software."

  content: ! "About 2 years ago I did a project in Las Vegas for a major maker of
    slot machines.\r\n\r\nThey do extensive testing and have very long product cycles.
    \ At that time they were making new games with everything from NT4 to W2K to XP
    and Linux.  \r\n\r\nI am sure that they are using far more Linux and probably
    no more NT4 today.   The key is that even as alate as 2004 they were still using
    NT4 and there was no clear pattern between the type of game (slot, video Poker,
    other) and the core OS.\r\n\r\nAs we all know from the customer side they just
    take our money and don't care."

  content: ! "Frank, no, for security reasons, I dont. However, it was using bash
    2.90b :D\r\n\r\nDaBlade - no idea - but resetting the computer, the machine server
    and the sensors fixes it ;)\r\n\r\nkoke, hey dude! hows things? lol ... havent
    heard from you since I lost you in customs at heathrow! - And hey - they dont
    just use linux ... just this provider of systems does.\r\n\r\nMark - I'm not too
    sure about the slots... but I know the main systems in the casino use some sort
    of windows based system (EndX only runs on that!) but yeah - it's nice to see
    linux :D"

<p>For those of you who don't know me... You may be surprised to find out that I actually have a real Job.</p>
<p> I'm a dealer. No - not the drug kind, I work in a casino. <a href="http://www.galacasino.com/CasinoDetails.aspx?casinoID=4">Gala Casino in Birmingham</a> in fact.</p>
<p>Anyway - today - I'm sitting there, dealing a game of roulette, when all of a sudden, the "winning number display" crashes. Leaving an xterm on screen.</p>
<p>Considering that most of our electronic gaming equipment is supplied by the same manufacturer, I'd assume that they're all running Linux... Which means - that, at work - I'm surrounded by Linux.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised by the quality of how everything is linked in together, including the "table top" display (a big table which shows a 3D rendering of the roulette wheel). These are all linked to Smart Card Cash terminals... it's pretty amazing how linux is being used. I'm happy to see it being used in a way other than just for servers. Rock on ACE systems!</p>
