  content: A friend of mine once had access to a foil plotter and made me this http://sven.stormbind.net/snap/pa100143.jpg
    out of a b/w converted Tux found somehere on the internet. I'd suggest you to
    find some friend with access to a foil plotter aswell. ;) Be aware that you own
    them some beer afterwards because it's hard to get the foil out of the eyes without
    breaking the rest.

<p>Random plea for free stuff.</p>
<p>If anyone out there has any geeky stickers (or anything a bit random for a sticker) lying around, please send them to me!</p>
<p>I'd rather not put my address on the intarwebs, so please feel free to email me on martin AT sourceguru DOT net if you have something to send me, and I will happily send you out a Stamped Addressed Envelope.</p>
<p>The stickers will be put to good use decorating my laptop ;)</p>
<p><strong>Edit:-</strong></p>
<p>I've just realised that sending a SASE to another country really doesn't work particularly well, different countries use different stamps after all!!!!<br />
I'm trying to think up a solution, but please let it be known that I am in the U.K., so if you're outside and want to send me stickers, you may have to help me come up with a solution for getting round the whole stamp thing!</p>
