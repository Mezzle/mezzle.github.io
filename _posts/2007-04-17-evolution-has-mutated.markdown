    the email programs or the filters for junk mail. We should blame the people behind
    the jung mail ... I have had job-related emails in my junk mail with a googlemail
    account.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to share this thought.\r\n\r\n- stef"

    Anyway, Evolution just sucks and I hope the people at o-hand.com will soon release
    a "mails" application ;)'

<p>Every now and then, I go through my junk folder in Evolution, and check it for any emails that should have got to me.</p>
<p>I've just checked it and found that there were more  emails that weren't junk in there than were. It's been filtering innocuous emails for no apparent reason, including a couple relating to a Job application I was going for (this was the reason I was checking it today, so luckily I spotted it!)</p>
<p>It's annoying when spam filters get too smart though. It's things like this that make me start wanting to use fetchmail/procmail, so that only the stuff I want marked as junk gets marked as junk.</p>
<p>Ah well, it's easy enough to turn off Evolution's Junk mail filtering.</p>
