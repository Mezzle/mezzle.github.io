  content: ! "Sounds like a neat solution.\r\n\r\nMy approach was to buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skytronic-Remote-Control-Switch-Set/dp/B000H9HU70/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1254602276&amp;sr=8-1\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">these remote control power switches</a> and plug lamps into them.\r\n\r\nSo
    I too can control the lighting around my house without getting out of bed.\r\n\r\n(I've
    also got a motion-sensitive light controller in my bathroom - so I walk in and
    the light goes on.  That's so cool!)"

  content: ! "I use a Tellstick from http://www.telldus.se/ which control some radio
    controlled remote swiches. I only have units that works in an ordinary socket,
    but I am planing on adding some radio controlled light swithces too. It makes
    it easy to controll lots of things from the computer.\r\nI have a Linksys NSL2
    server with Debian/Lenny running 24/7 controlling lights in bedroom, livingroom
    and the kitchen. It also controlls my water boiler and radio in the kitchen and
    the light to my aquariums.\r\n\r\nIt is realy nice to have.  Planing to have a
    IR remote device added, but have not made any decisions on how to use it yet."

  content: ! "I have a complete X-10 home automation set, cost me like $100, that
    I never ever use because the developers of Heyu seem to have something against
    packaging their app for end users and the MOTU don't like their bizarre software
    license.\r\n\r\nBut even if I did use it, the stuff only works with incandecsent
    bulbs.  I recently bought like $200 of stuff from ThinkGeek and one of the things
    was that remote controlled LED bulb-- it's very novel, but not very bright.\r\n\r\nBut
    then, I do all my reading on my laptop anyways."

  content: ! "There are also electronic wall dimmer switches. Normally, you tap the
    button to turn the lights off. But with an extended press of the button, it will
    slowly dim the lights to off over 30 or 60 seconds, so that you have time to get
    into bed before it turns off. They cost around 20 USD.\r\n\r\nOf course, they
    only work with dimmable lamps."

<p>I'm an avid reader, and normally curl up in bed at the end of a long day with a book.  However, since I've  been in my current flat, I've had a bit of a problem, as I don't like to leave a light on while I'm sleeping.</p>
<p>So, seeing as my bed is at the opposite end of the room than my light switch, and I also tend to sleep on the side furthest from the light switch, my night-time habit would be something like this:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on light</li>
<li>Walk to other side of room.</li>
<li>Walk round bed</li>
<li>Turn on bedside lamp</li>
<li>Walk back around bed</li>
<li>Walk back to light switch</li>
<li>Turn off light</li>
<li>Walk back to bed, and around it</li>
<li>Get into bed</li>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Turn off bedside lamp</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Not exactly good when you've had a hard days work, and just want to curl up and read a book until you fall asleep.</p>
<p>On Wednesday however, I stumbled across a <a href="http://theinternetswitchstore.co.uk/view.php?cat=14">range of products</a> on the net, and ordered a remote control light switch, and also a remote to go with it. My bedtime arrangements are now:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on light</li>
<li>Walk to bed</li>
<li>Get into bed</li>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Turn off light with remote control</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot more easier!</p>
<p>Have been playing with the remote from my office, and I think that if I were to order more switches, I'd be able to turn on/off all the lights in my flat from my desk.</p>
<p>Another neat feature about these lights? They can be programmed to use any button on any remote control!</p>
<p>Oh, and also, The Birmingham Jam is going pretty well!</p>
