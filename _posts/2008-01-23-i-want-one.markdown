  content: hehe, at first I thought it was just a lil dancing thing - like-  remember
    those dancing flowers? Or I think I had a dancing coke can ... o_O had fun taking
    that apart, but actually watching these videos, and reading up on the thing, it's
    even cooler than I thought - I REALLY want one now
