<p>So, am sittig in my hotel room, after spending way too long getting here, drinking tea, and using up the Wifi.</p>
<p>It doesn't actually start till tomorrow, so not much to say - but I shall probably blog some more.</p>
<p>Good night out tonight, with a few of the Speakers, some good conversation, though really dissappointed that everywhere stops selling food at like - 10pm. Which is about when we got to the hotel. I think I've had a single bitterballe (or however it's spelt) - roll on breakfast tomorrow morning is all I can say - and dissapointed that the place we went to only had two kinds of beer, or wine.... :(</p>
<p>Still, all good fun, looking forward to tomorrow. Just not liking the fact I have a single bed. I haven't slept in one for 6 years!</p>
